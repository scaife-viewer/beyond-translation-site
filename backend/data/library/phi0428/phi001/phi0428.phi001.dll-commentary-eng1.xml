               <p>This sentence describes the last and most impressive of the defensive measures
                  adopted by the Alexandrians against the newly arrived Caesar, namely, the
                  construction of moveable siege towers. <foreign xml:lang="la">Obiectis</foreign>
                  is the principal problem in this passage: its authenticity has long been
                  questioned, with <ref target="#Scaliger">Scaliger</ref> excising it and other
                  critics offering emendations. <foreign xml:lang="la">Confixerant</foreign>, too,
                  has been suspected.</p>

               <p>1) As transmitted, the verb used to report the towers’ construction is <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">confixerant</foreign>, “had cobbled together.” At its one other
                  occurrence in the corpus in the context of construction the presence of an
                  instrumental ablative shows the verb to be used more literally: <hi rend="italic"
                     >BG</hi> 3.13.4 <foreign xml:lang="la">transtra ex pedalibus in altitudinem
                     trabibus confixa</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >erant</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="la">clauis ferris</foreign>.<note
                     place="foot">Similar usages are attested in other authors (<hi rend="italic"
                        >TLL</hi> 4.211.67–79 ‘figendo instruere’). Elsewhere in the corpus <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">configere</foreign> appears in the context of combat: <hi
                        rend="italic">BAlex</hi> 40.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">legio … confixa et
                        oppressa est</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">BAfr</hi> 59.5 <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">exercitum … iaculis configeret.</foreign></note>
                  Construction-related passages lacking the ablative can be found in, e.g.,
                  Vitruvius (10.6.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">tigna conlocantur in capitibus utraque
                     parte habentia transuersaria confixa</foreign>; cf. 10.9.6, 10.15.7; see
                  further <hi rend="italic">TLL</hi> 4.211.79–212.3 ‘figendo coniungere’). But
                  nowhere is the reference of the prepositional prefix as vague as it is in our
                  passage: what is being fastened to what? Accordingly, substitutes have been
                  supplied, <foreign xml:lang="la">confecerant</foreign> in the manuscript tradition
                  itself, perhaps based on a later construction passage (13.4 <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >paucis diebus contra omnium opinionem</foreign>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">quadriremes XXII, quinqueremes V confecerunt</foreign>),
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">confinxerant</foreign> by Dauisius, appealing to Pliny
                  for support (<hi rend="italic">Nat</hi>. 10.93 <foreign xml:lang="la">eadem
                     materia confingunt nidas</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">hirundines</foreign>]). The latter verb, however, does not seem
                  to be used for human construction projects (<hi rend="italic">TLL</hi>
                  4.214.60–73), and the former, although apparently apt, does not impose itself: in
                  chapter 13 the prefix denotes completion rather than assembly. A better repair
                  might be <foreign xml:lang="la">contexerant</foreign>, which Caesar uses in
                  describing the protective coverings supplied for his mobile siege “tortoise” both
                  with an instrumental ablative (<hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 2.10.6 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">coria … centonibus conteguntur</foreign>) and absolutely (<hi
                     rend="italic">BC</hi> 2.10.5 <foreign xml:lang="la">musculus ut ab igni … tutus
                     esset contegitur</foreign>).<note place="foot">He also uses it in connection
                     with boats that are supplied either with decks (<hi rend="italic">BC</hi>
                     2.4.2) or with camouflage (<hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.24.1).</note></p>

               <p>2) <foreign xml:lang="la">Obiectis</foreign>, which occurs later in the
                  description of these moveable military towers, makes little sense in context: if
                  pack animals are pulling the towers, it is hard to see the relevance of their
                  having been “placed opposite,” “in front of,” or “in the way of” the towers. The
                  parallelism between <foreign xml:lang="la">funibus</foreign> and <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">iumentis</foreign> is also peculiar.</p>

               <p><ref target="#Scaliger">Scaliger</ref> addressed both problems by excising
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">obiectis</foreign>, removing the reference to the
                  animals’ position and construing <foreign xml:lang="la">funibus
                     iumentisque</foreign> as instrumental ablatives with <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >mouebant</foreign>. With this repair one can perhaps see <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">obiectis</foreign> as a garbled reprise of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >subiectis</foreign> or a garbled anticipation of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >derectis</foreign>. However, in the Caesarian corpus there is no other
                  instance of an instrumental ablative with <foreign xml:lang="la">moueo</foreign>:
                  nobody ever moves an object by means of something else.<note place="foot">The
                     verb <foreign xml:lang="la">moueo</foreign> in Caesar is most often used in the
                     idiom <foreign xml:lang="la">mouere castra</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">BG</hi>
                     1.39.7, 2.2.6, etc.) or in similar phrases involving the movement of troops or
                     the changing of location (<hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 3.15.3, etc.). Often
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">moueo</foreign> is used in the passive voice, when
                     someone is figuratively moved by something <hi rend="italic">(BG</hi> 7.76.2,
                        <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.4.2, etc.).</note> This is a usage with few
                  parallels in Latin more generally (see <hi rend="italic">TLL</hi> 8.1540.47–60).
                  In the passive <foreign xml:lang="la">moueo</foreign> can be used with an ablative
                  of manner (cf. Cic. <hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> 9.14, something moved <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">nulla ui</foreign>) or absolutely, as when towers are moved
                  forward in sieges (cf. <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 2.31.1, Curt. 4.6.9). The best
                  parallel for an active <foreign xml:lang="la">moueo</foreign> with an object and
                  an instrumental ablative — also a rope, as it turns out — comes from Propertius
                  (4.11.51 <foreign xml:lang="la">tu, quae tardam mouisti fune Cybeben</foreign>).
                  Because of the absence of relevant parallels for this usage, it seems prudent to
                  proceed with the assumption that a participle is needed where the text reads
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">obiectis</foreign> in order to form a second ablative
                  absolute with <foreign xml:lang="la">funibus iumentisque</foreign>.<note
                     place="foot">There is a comparable asyndetic pair of absolutes in a similar
                     string of different sorts of ablatives at <hi rend="italic">BAlex</hi> 11.6,
                     which is also, incidentally, a passage about towing: <foreign xml:lang="la">Hac

                        Caesar remulco uictricibus suis nauibus Alexandriam deducit</foreign>. The
                     expression <foreign xml:lang="la">naues remulco uictricibus suis nauibus
                        deducit</foreign> is a decent structural parallel for <ref

                        >remulco</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">nauibus</foreign> work
                     reasonably well with <foreign xml:lang="la">deducit</foreign> (cf. <hi
                        rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.40.1), whereas neither of our ablatives works well
                     with <foreign xml:lang="la">mouebant</foreign>. For other long strings of
                     ablatives see 27.5 and 32.3.</note></p>

               <p><ref target="#Castiglioni">Castiglioni</ref> emended <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >obiectis</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la">adiectis</foreign>, assuming a
                  palaeographically plausible innovation. This gives the sense of “fastened upon” or
                  “added to.” Forms of <foreign xml:lang="la">adicere</foreign> occur ten times in
                  the corpus, but it usually means to add on or adjoin something abstract or to
                  describe geographical space (cf., e.g., 28.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">unum
                     latus</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >castrorum</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="la">erat adiectum flumini
                     Nilo</foreign>). Here it would imply that the animals are added on to a larger
                  contraption, which does not yield perfect sense.</p>

               <p><ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref> proposed <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >obtectis</foreign> to describe the animals, which would be “covered” or
                  “protected.” Caesar uses <foreign xml:lang="la">obtectus</foreign> to refer to
                  military protection, which would suggest that the pack animals are shielded from
                  opposing attack (cf. <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.19.7 <foreign xml:lang="la">quae
                        [<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. tela] ille obtectus armis militum
                     uitauit</foreign> and 3.54.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">uineis eam partem castrorum
                     obtexit</foreign>). The context of our sentence does not necessitate this idea,
                  and the necessity of taking <foreign xml:lang="la">iumentis</foreign> in tandem
                  with <foreign xml:lang="la">funibus</foreign> makes it unlikely.</p>

               <p>Contexts involving pack animals towing something frequently contain the verb
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">iungere</foreign>. There are two potential problems with
                  an emendation based on <foreign xml:lang="la">iungere</foreign>, however. First,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">iunctis</foreign> is paleographically further removed
                  from <foreign xml:lang="la">obiectis</foreign> than either <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adiectis</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">obtectis</foreign>. Second,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">iungere</foreign> usually refers to joining animals to
                  one another rather than to other objects. However, the verb does occur with the
                  etymologically related <foreign xml:lang="la">iumentum</foreign> (Nepos <hi
                     rend="italic">Timol.</hi> 4.2, Varro <hi rend="italic">RR</hi> 1.52.1; cf. Var.
                     <hi rend="italic">LL</hi> 5.136) and in one passage of Vitruvius a yoked team
                  of oxen pull a rope (Vitr. 10.2.14 <foreign xml:lang="la">bubus iunctis funem
                     ducebant [<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. boues]</foreign>). So <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">iunctis</foreign> is worth consideration here, even if <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">funibus</foreign> is a loose end.</p>

               <p>Compounds of <foreign xml:lang="la">iunctis</foreign> are also worth considering.
                     <ref target="#Cornelissen">Cornelissen</ref> suggested <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >subiunctis</foreign>, making the ropes and pack animals “subjoined” to the
                  towers. He cites as parallels a line from Columella in which bullocks are attached
                  to a plow (Col. 6.2.8 <foreign xml:lang="la">uacuo plostro subiungendi</foreign>)
                  and a line from Virgil in which tigers are joined to a chariot (Virg. <hi
                     rend="italic">Ecl.</hi> 5.29 <foreign xml:lang="la">curru subiungere
                     tigres</foreign>). Neither passage offers a parallel for <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >funibus</foreign>, which sits oddly with the prefix <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >sub</foreign>-, and the verb itself appears nowhere else in the corpus. The
                  form <foreign xml:lang="la">adiunctis</foreign>, from a verb used eight times in
                  the <title>Bellum Alexandrinum</title> and twenty-five times in the corpus
                  overall, is perhaps a better repair. Aulus Gellius uses <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adiunctis</foreign> absolutely with <foreign xml:lang="la">iumenta</foreign>
                  (Gel. 20.1.28 <foreign xml:lang="la">uectaculum … quod adiunctis pecoribus
                     trahebatur</foreign>), and Horace uses it jokingly to describe yoking mice to a
                  cart (Hor. <hi rend="italic">Sat</hi>. 2.3.247 <foreign xml:lang="la">plostello
                     adiungere mures</foreign>). However, nowhere in the corpus does <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">adiungere</foreign> describe affixing something to an object.</p>

               <p>It therefore seems best to leave <foreign xml:lang="la">obiectis</foreign> in its
                  imperfection with the understanding that the syntax and general sense are clear,
                  even if the original verb is not.</p>

               <p>In the passage quoted above the string <foreign xml:lang="la">ut …
                     absumeretur</foreign> is excised by <ref target="#Gruterus">Gruterus</ref>
                  (along with the following sentence), emended by many, and daggered by <ref
                     target="#Andrieu">Andrieu</ref>. The general problem is the loose logical
                  connection between the Alexandrians’ apparent loyalty to the Romans (<foreign
                     xml:lang="la">uidebatur</foreign>) and the idea that they require a defense
                  from the author (<foreign xml:lang="la">ut mihi defendendi essent</foreign>). What
                  we want to be told instead, as <ref target="#Madvig">Madvig</ref> observed (1873,
                     <ref
                     target="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=%3Bseq=293"
                     >281</ref>), is why the Roman fears expressed in 7.1 (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >alii … extimescerent … quod neque celari Alexandrini possent in apparanda
                     fuga, … neque illis imminentibus atque insequentibus ullus in naues receptus
                     daretur</foreign>) were justified. A further problem is that the hypothetical
                  defense is contradicted by later critiques centered on Alexandrian deceptiveness
                  (24.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">Caesar etsi fallacem gentem semperque alia
                     cogitantem, alia simulantem bene cognitam habebat</foreign>, 24.3 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">regius animus disciplinis fallacissimis eruditus, ne a gentis
                     suae moribus degeneraret</foreign>; cf. also 24.6 <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >fallaciis pueri</foreign>).</p>

               <p>Editors who accept the basic authenticity of the transmitted text have to contend
                  with a series of problems within the string itself, the most significant of which
                  lie in the connectives. As transmitted the relevant part of the passage reads as
                  follows:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote"> … desciuisse a suis uidebatur ut mihi defendendi essent
                  Alexandrini <hi rend="underline">neque</hi> fallaces essent <hi rend="underline"
                     >neque</hi> temerarii multa<hi rend="underline">que</hi> oratio frustra
                  absumeretur. </quote>

               <p>The connectives string together three dissimilar propositions: the opening
                  reference to the necessity of a defense stands in parallel to <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">neque fallaces essent neque temerarii</foreign>, which looks like
                  part of the hypothetical defense and therefore seems to warrant subordination, and
                  also to a declaration that defense would be a waste of breath, where the
                  apparently adversative sense needs more than a linking <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >-que</foreign>. The following sentence compounds the problem by abandoning the
                  idea of defense and instead indicting the Alexandrians for their aptitude for
                  treachery. (Here, however, we do get a nice robust <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >uero</foreign>.)</p>

               <p>Smaller problems include the singular pronoun <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >mihi</foreign>, which clashes with the normally plural forms used for self
                  reference by the author, and the word <foreign xml:lang="la">absumo</foreign>,
                  which is used nowhere else in the corpus and generally avoided by Incertus’
                  contemporaries. The punctuation is another variable: the string <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">ut … absumeretur</foreign> is sometimes printed as a stand-alone
                  sentence and sometimes integrated with what precedes. The passage also suffers
                  from guilt by association, so to speak, in that criticism of the Alexandrians is
                  associated with textual problems elsewhere in the work.<note place="foot">See,

                     perhaps, is the peculiar repeated omission of the subject <foreign

               <p><ref target="#Gruterus">Gruterus’</ref> excision is a drastic response to this

               <p>1) <foreign xml:lang="la">Mihi</foreign> is indeed a striking move by Incertus,

                  mentioned above, for authorial comments he, like Caesar, usually employs the
                  plural (28.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">demonstrauimus</foreign>, 33.2 <foreign

                  However, there are exceptions to this, in Incertus as in Caesar (30.5 <foreign

                     <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 6.14.4 (<foreign xml:lang="la">id mihi duabus de

                     xml:lang="la">Galli</foreign>]), it does not in itself warrant suspicion about
                  the authenticity of the passage.</p>
               <p>2) <foreign xml:lang="la">Absumeretur</foreign> is the only word in the passage
                  that is alien to the Caesarian corpus and indeed to its time period. One might
                  have expected <foreign xml:lang="la">consumeretur</foreign>, from a synonymous
                  verb that occurs more than 40 times in the corpus (cf. <hi rend="italic">BC</hi>
                  1.33.4 <foreign xml:lang="la">frustra diebus aliquot consumptis</foreign>). But
                  the presence of the <soCalled>wrong</soCalled> prefix is a very slender cause for
                  suspicion, since altering the prefix is a frequent form of innovation in this
                  tradition and the often abbreviated <foreign xml:lang="la">con</foreign>- is
                  particularly susceptible.<note place="foot">See <ref target="#Damon2015a">Damon

               <p>3) The logical problems mentioned above have elicited numerous repairs. Many
                  editors will have felt, with Madvig, a reluctance to excise something whose origin
                  they cannot explain.<note place="foot">Thus <ref target="#Madvig">Madvig</ref>

                  appears with four deviations from what we now know to be the paradosis, and two of
                  these emendations were accepted by many subsequent editors, namely, the addition
                  of <foreign xml:lang="la">quod</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Alexandrini</foreign> and the excision of -<foreign xml:lang="la"

               <p>The first of these innovations creates the subordination desiderated above, the

                     absumerent</foreign> rather isolated. Neither <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >tum</foreign> nor <foreign xml:lang="la">absumerent</foreign> is essential to
                  the repair and they were quickly dropped when better manuscript evidence became
                  available, as in the edition of <ref target="#Vascosanus">Vascosanus</ref>, who
                  also retained <foreign xml:lang="la">-que</foreign> and repunctuated:</p>

               <p>With this repair <foreign xml:lang="la">multa … absumeretur</foreign> is now
                  parallel to <foreign xml:lang="la">defendendi essent</foreign> in a clause whose
                  loose syntactic connection to <foreign xml:lang="la">desciuisse a suis
                     uidebatur</foreign> matches the above-mentioned looseness of thought. The
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign>-clause has to be a result clause of sorts,
                  but the antecedent cause is the unstated implication of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >uidebatur</foreign>: “they <hi rend="underline">seemed</hi> to have cut their
                  ties with their own side (but people feared they had not).” And even with this
                  inference the connection between cause and result is quite loose. Only when we get
                  to following sentence, with its introductory <foreign xml:lang="la">cum
                     uero</foreign>, do we see that the point of our passage is that it would be a
                  waste of time to argue that the fears were misplaced, since the evidence for
                  Alexandrian treacherousness is close to hand.<note place="foot"><ref

               <p>The innovation is easy to explain as a “correction” designed to bring <foreign

                     >absumeretur</foreign>. There are comparable snippets of loosely integrated
                  indirect statement in the Corpus, often in connection with verbs denoting
                  emotional intensity, as here with <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >defendendi</foreign>.<note place="foot">Cf. <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 3.6.1

                     5.1.298.84–299.4) the equivalent for <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >Alexandrini</foreign> in our passage is a reflexive pronoun (e.g., Liu.
                     32.40.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">ille ab ipsis Argiuis se defenderet
                        accitum</foreign>). The nominative <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >temerarii</foreign> in our passage indicates that the “snippet” is
                     notionally dependent on a verb such as <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >uiderentur</foreign>.</note> And Incertus gives us another rather loose
                  result clause at 22.2: <foreign xml:lang="la">Nec diuulgata Caesaris hortatio
                     subsequi legionum aut laborem aut pugnandi poterat cupiditatem, ut magis

               <p>On balance it seems best to accept this minimally emended text. The logic is murky

               <p>The first sentence of this passage, as transmitted, has a number of glaring
                  problems. The most substantial is the incompatibility of the main clause, which is
                  about a loss of morale (<foreign xml:lang="la">adeo sunt fracti
                     Alexandrini</foreign>), and the apparent result clause, which is about
                  defensive capability (<foreign xml:lang="la">ut ex aedificiis defendi
                     possent</foreign>). The antecedent of <foreign xml:lang="la">quibus</foreign>
                  is another puzzle: does the relative pronoun refer to Roman <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >classiarii</foreign>, Alexandrians, or something that can function in tandem
                  with <foreign xml:lang="la">locis</foreign>? And then there is the difficulty of
                  making sense of <foreign xml:lang="la">materiam cunctam</foreign> in light of the
                  earlier assertion that Alexandrian buildings contained no <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >materia</foreign> (1.3 <foreign xml:lang="la"><supplied reason="lost"
                        >ab</supplied> incendio fere tuta est Alexandria, quod sine contignatione ac

                     rudere aut pauimentis</foreign>). These problems are interconnected, which
                  complicates the task of seeing and explaining solutions, but the context,
                  especially the subsequent sentence (quoted above), provides something of a
                  framework to use in approaching them.</p>

               <p>The passage we are concerned with reports the beginning of the aftermath of an
                  unexpected naval defeat suffered by the Alexandrians, who had hoped to catch
                  Caesar in a moment of vulnerability (10.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">magnam sibi
                     facultatem fortunam obtulisse bene gerendae rei crediderunt</foreign>) but
                  barely avoided losing their entire fleet (11.5 <foreign xml:lang="la">Quod nisi
                     nox proelium diremisset, tota classe hostium Caesar potitus esset</foreign>).
                  In the sentence immediately before our passage they return to Alexandria terrified
                  (11.6 <foreign xml:lang="la">perterritis</foreign>). The immediately following
                  sentence, introduced with an emphatic <foreign xml:lang="la">idem</foreign>, shows
                  the resilience of their military commander, Ganymedes (see 4.2), and the revival
                  of hope and confidence in the Alexandrians themselves. Details follow in
                  12.3–13.4. This is the context into which our problematic sentence needs to
                  fit.</p>

               <p>It will be helpful to begin by reviewing the (relatively) secure ground in our
                  sentence. As was mentioned above, it begins with the Alexandrian loss of morale
                     (<foreign xml:lang="la">adeo sunt fracti Alexandrini</foreign>). It ends with a
                  causal clause concerning their fears about a possible fleet-based attack on the
                  city (<foreign rend="italic">quod nostrae classis oppugnationem etiam ad terram
                     uerebantur</foreign>). <foreign xml:lang="la">Verebantur</foreign> might be a
                  restatement of <foreign xml:lang="la">fracti</foreign>, but it might also show
                  that the Alexandrians have overcome their panic and started taking sensible
                  precautions. In the latter scenario, our sentence mirrors the turnaround reported
                  in 12.2. In the former scenario, our sentence stands in contrast to 12.2. The
                  emphatic <foreign xml:lang="la">idem</foreign> is compatible with either scenario
                  (parallel: <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 6.13.5, <hi rend="italic">BAfr</hi> 22.2,
                  28.2; contrasting: <hi rend="italic">BAlex</hi> 18.3). According to the <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">cum</foreign>-clause, the morale problem was particularly acute
                  because the Alexandrians had been defeated in the arena where they felt most
                  confident, the sea, and now needed to defend themselves on land, a situation that
                  seems to underlie both <foreign xml:lang="la">aedificiis defendi possent</foreign>
                  and <foreign rend="italic">materiam … obicerent</foreign>.</p>

               <p>Early editors left the spot alone, presumably taking the antecedent for <foreign
                     rend="italic">quibus</foreign> to be <foreign xml:lang="la">uirtus</foreign>
                  and <foreign rend="italic">scientia</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >quibus</foreign> itself as an instrumental ablative parallel to <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">locis</foreign> (cf. <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 1.40.6 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">quos … usus ac disciplina … subleuarent</foreign>). The lack of
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">materia</foreign> in Alexandria is perhaps made less
                  worrisome by a later passage about roof beams (13.2 <foreign rend="italic"
                     >Porticus gymnasia publica aedificia detegebant, asseres remorum usum
                     obtinebant</foreign>) that encourages taking 1.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">sine
                     contignatione ac materia</foreign> as a hendiadys, “without wooden decking.”
                  But the larger sense problem eventually attracted attention and a variety of
                  approaches.</p>

               <p><ref target="#Manutius">Manutius</ref> proposed a simple solution to the
                  aforementioned incompatibility, replacing <foreign xml:lang="la">ex</foreign> with
                  the negation <foreign xml:lang="la">uix</foreign>: the Alexandrians are so
                  dispirited by the naval disaster that they can <hi rend="underline">scarcely</hi>
                  feel secure in the city itself. It is easy enough to supposed that <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">uix</foreign> was misread as <foreign xml:lang="la">ex</foreign>
                  before <foreign xml:lang="la">aedificiis</foreign>, and a similar scene plays out
                  later on Pharos Island with an explicit reference to the situation in Alexandria:
                  18.1 <foreign rend="italic">Neque uero diutius ea munitione se continere potuerunt
                     etsi erat non dissimile atque Alexandriae genus aedificiorum, ut minora
                     maioribus conferantur, turresque editae et coniunctae muri locum
                     obtinebant</foreign>.</p>

               <p>But neither <ref target="#Manutius">Manutius</ref>’ repair, nor <ref
                     target="#Dinter">Dinter</ref>'s subsequent suggestion that <foreign
                     rend="italic">uix</foreign> fell out before <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >ex</foreign>, sits at all well with <foreign xml:lang="la">cunctam</foreign>. And
                  yet the two subjunctive expressions seem to be aligned in content as well as
                  form.</p>

               <p><ref target="#Rhellicanus">Rhellicanus</ref> took a completely different approach,
                  supplying (or understanding) <foreign xml:lang="la">a</foreign> before <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">quibus</foreign> and specifying that the antecedent is <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">classiariorum</foreign>.<note place="foot">Rhellicanus’ note as
                     quoted by <ref target="#Jungermann">Jungermann</ref> is not clear on this
                     point, but it does not seem possible to take <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >quibus</foreign> (without <foreign xml:lang="la">a</foreign>) as a
                     separation ablative in context; Cellarius’ paraphrase of Rhellicanus includes
                     the preposition. <foreign xml:lang="la">Quibus</foreign> is construed as an
                     instrumental ablative parallel to <foreign xml:lang="la">superioribus
                        locis</foreign> by Glandorp, taking the antecedent to be <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">classiarii sui</foreign>, but the Alexandrian sailors are
                     never called <foreign xml:lang="la">classiarii</foreign>.</note> The idea is
                  that the Alexandrians’ elevated positions provided them with assistance <hi
                     rend="underline">against</hi> attackers coming from the Roman fleet. Incertus
                  does use the preposition <foreign xml:lang="la">ab</foreign> in this sense (78.2
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">prouincias … <hi rend="underline">a barbaris atque
                        inimicis regibus</hi> … muniuit</foreign>, cf. 61.3 <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >ab oppugnatione tutus</foreign>), and similar usages can be found elsewhere in
                  the corpus (cf. esp. Hirt. 8.9.4 <foreign xml:lang="la">ut <hi rend="underline">ab
                        hostibus</hi> duplici fossa, duplici propugnatorum ordine

                     >subleuabantur</foreign>, with which <foreign xml:lang="la">a quibus</foreign>
                  would be much more likely to be construed as a personal agent (cf. <hi
                     rend="italic">BG</hi> 1.16.6 <foreign xml:lang="la">grauiter eos accusat quod …
                     ab iis non subleuetur</foreign>). With this repair the point of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">et</foreign> is also hard to fathom.</p>

               <p><ref target="#Dauisius1706">Davies</ref> postulated a lacuna in the text before
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">quibus</foreign>. But therafter he rather throws up his
                  hands, “cum de locis tam mutilis nihil certo possit definiri.” <ref
                     target="#Nipperdey">Nipperdey</ref> placed the lacuna after <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">quibus</foreign>, a position preferred by subsequent editors
                  since it allows one to avoid specifying the identity of the antecedent: it could
                  be the Romans or the Alexandrians, or for that matter <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >uirtus</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">scientia</foreign>. Both lacunas
                  leave a space in which the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la">materia
                     cuncta</foreign> might have been made clear. But we will argue below that the
                  expression <foreign xml:lang="la">locis subleuabantur</foreign> is
                  problematic.</p>

               <p>First, however, another approach. <ref target="#Dinter">Dinter</ref> rewrote the
                  passage:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote"> adeo sunt fracti Alexandrini … ut uix ex aedificiis defendi
                  posse se confiderent, quibus et superioribus locis subleuabantur, et materiam
                  cunctam obicerent, quod nostrae classis oppugnationem etiam ad terram
                  uerebantur.</quote>

               <quote rend="blockquote">The Alexandrians were so shattered … that they scarcely
                  trusted that it was possible for themselves to be defended from the buildings,
                  from which, as well as from their higher positions, they used to derive support,
                  and interposed all the wood as a barrier, because they feared an attack by our
                  fleet even on land.</quote>

               <p>The core of this repair is a transposition, but it also involves adding <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">uix</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="la">ex</foreign> (as was
                  mentioned above) and emending <foreign xml:lang="la">possent</foreign> to <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">posse se confiderent</foreign>.<note place="foot">Many will
                     share <ref target="#Larsen">Larsen</ref>’s reaction (1886, 6): “hac tanta
                     licentia locum sanari non posse, omnes statim intellegent.” Further changes are
                     proposed by <ref target="Fleischer">Fleischer</ref> 1879, 860.</note> It also
                  requires that the negation be taken with only the first of two parallel verbs,
                  with <foreign xml:lang="la">confiderent</foreign> but not <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >obicerent</foreign>. In other words, the syntax is difficult, the necessary
                  sequence of innovations is implausibly complicated, and the mystery of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">materia cuncta</foreign> is revived.</p>

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">temporibus</foreign> might refer to. But <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">locis</foreign> does deserve scrutiny.</p>

               <p>One necessary step in wringing sense from the transmitted text is deciding whether
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">subleuabatur</foreign> is to be taken literally (“raised
                  up”) or metaphorically (“assisted”), and how <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >locis</foreign> is to be construed with it. The verb is accompanied by simple
                  ablatives in both its literal (<hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 1.48.7 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">iubis equorum subleuati</foreign>) and metaphorical senses (e.g.,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">re … frumentaria</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >industria</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la">anni tempore</foreign>, <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">opibus</foreign>). But there are no good parallels for <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">locis</foreign> with either sense of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >subleuari</foreign>. The expression <foreign xml:lang="la">superioribus
                     locis</foreign> might suggest that literal lifting is appropriate here but the
                  imperfect tense is against it.<note place="foot">Unless the subject of <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">subleuabantur</foreign> is something like <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">asseres</foreign> (cf. 13.2) and the lost text shows that the
                     imperfect has a sense other than “used to be.” This would clarify <foreign

                     But this passage provides no help for the construction of our passage.</note>
                  It therefore seems unlikely that the ablative is instrumental in our passage. As a
                  local ablative <foreign xml:lang="la">locis superioribus</foreign> appears in the
                  corpus both with and without the preposition <foreign xml:lang="la">in</foreign>.
                  It might also be part of an ablative absolute (cf. <hi rend="italic">BG</hi>

                  compatible with a lacuna after <foreign xml:lang="la">et</foreign>.</p>

               <p>This leaves us with a relative clause beginning <foreign xml:lang="la">quibus

                  material lost in the lacuna would perhaps describe how despite the defeat the
                  Alexandrians began to contemplate a land-based defense as a preliminary to the

                     were contradictory — “cursus enim in littore Aegyptio erat confectus” (1847,
                     190) — and therefore excised <foreign xml:lang="la">litore</foreign> as a
                     scribal gloss on the unusual expression <foreign xml:lang="la">in cursu
                        Aegyptio</foreign>. It is indeed unusual: the common expression <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">in cursu</foreign> never takes an adjectival toponym. Such
                     adjectives are, however, used with <foreign xml:lang="la">litus</foreign> (cf.,

                        >sub litore</foreign> elsewhere weighs against this emendation. Furthermore,

               <p>What is immediately clear, and should make us wary of accepting <ref
                     target="#Schneider">Schneider</ref>’s conjecture too readily, is that, with or
                  without the conjecture, the list at 1.1 does not correspond to that at 13.5: in
                  the former, the sources for Caesar’s fleet are given as Rhodes, Syria, and
                  Cilicia; in the latter, the ships are from Rhodes, Pontus, and Asia, along with
                  whatever the lemma in question represents. Also relevant is Caesar’s report at <hi
                     rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.106.1: <foreign xml:lang="la">cum … nauibus longis

                     Caesar)</foreign>. If Caesar arrived in Alexandria with these ten Rhodian
                  ships, then summoned more from Rhodes (1.1), at the time of the harbor battle he
                  would have had more than the nine Rhodian ships reported in 13.5. <ref

                  parenthesis of the present sentence, an awkward addition, as we have seen, is
                  perhaps to be understood as Incertus’ clarification of Caesar’s shorthand at <hi

               <p><ref target="#Gaertner-Hausburg">Gaertner/Hausburg</ref> have recently defended

                     >decem missis</foreign> at 13.5 thus refers to the ten Rhodian ships said to
                  have come with Caesar at <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.106.1.<note place="foot">J.
                     F. Gaertner and B. Hausburg, 2013, <hi rend="italic">Caesar and the Bellum

                        rend="italic">La guerre d’Alexandrie</hi>, Cairo: 29–30: 101, and Andrieu
                     (1954, lviii–lix). Andrieu dismantles the argument in favor of the paradosis
                     based on 14.1–2, where Caesar is said to have positioned the Rhodian ships on
                     his right flank and the Pontic ships on his left, while the rest were set
                     behind them as reserves. The logic is that, reading the paradosis, each of the
                     ships on Caesar’s flanks would have exactly one assigned to it as a reserve,
                     with nine Rhodian and eight Pontic ships (=17) supported by five Lycian and
                     twelve Asian ships (=17). “Trop séduisante,” notes Andrieu, suggesting that one
                     can only infer a minimum of 34 ships, as the text does not require a one-to-one
                     correspondence between lines.</note> This would explain why the forces of 13.5
                  differ from those of 1.1 and provide grounds for rejecting Schneider’s attempt to
                  smooth over these differences.</p>

               <p>There remains one important question to answer: is there anything inherently
                  implausible in Caesar having a handful of ships from Lycia? Lycia, granted, is
                  mentioned nowhere else in the Caesarean corpus, and <ref target="#Townend"
                     >Townend</ref>, for one, finds the paradosis objectionable “since Lycia was not
                  a Roman province at this time.”<note place="foot">Townend, 1988, <hi
                        rend="italic">Caesar’s War in Alexandria</hi>, Bristol: 44</note> That,

                  Cicero tells us (<hi rend="italic">Att</hi>. 9.9.2), Lycia was one of the sources
                  for Pompey’s fleet just a few years earlier. Moreover, a recently published Greek
                  inscription on bronze shows that Caesar presided over the negotiation of a
                  generous treaty with the Lycians in 46 BCE, which several historians have
                  interpreted as a reward for the contingent of ships that (according to the
                  pre-Schneider text of the <title>Bellum Alexandrinum</title>) Lycia sent to
                     Egypt.<note place="foot"><foreign xml:lang="la">Editio princeps</foreign> and

               <p>In sum, it appears that the basis of Schneider’s conjecture is unreliable at best,
                  and that the paradosis, far from being historically objectionable, may actually
                  illuminate the condition of Romano-Lycian relations in the time of Caesar.</p>

                     meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la">hoc</foreign> is hard to discern. It
                     obviously points to the immediately preceding 16.7: <foreign xml:lang="la"

                  idea of attacking the city is irrelevant to the objective announced at the start
                  of the paragraph, which targets the island and jetty. What Incertus says about

                     elaborate repair: <foreign xml:lang="la">… munitionibus</foreign> [<foreign

               </p>

               <p>Another approach would be to assume that the missing parallel for <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">et illa</foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="la">m</foreign>) was lost in
                  an eye-skip from <foreign xml:lang="la">et</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >et</foreign>. The pronoun’s obscurity would be clarified if what was lost was
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">hac</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">hanc</foreign>.
                  Incertus’ usage elsewhere suggests that <foreign xml:lang="la">et ha</foreign>(<hi
                     rend="italic">n</hi>)<hi rend="italic">c</hi> preceded <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >et illa</foreign>(<hi rend="italic">m</hi>) (cf. 6.3 <hi rend="italic">haec
                     propior … illa inferior</hi>, 13.1 <hi rend="italic">has … illas</hi>, 19.2 <hi
                     rend="italic">hunc … illum</hi>). As between the accusative and the ablative,
                  the accusative seems preferable given the aforementioned objections to seeing
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">urbem</foreign> as a subject for <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >temptari</foreign>. This leaves the problem of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >urbe</foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="la">m</foreign>): where did it come from?
                  Perhaps it was spawned when the final <foreign xml:lang="la">m</foreign> of
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">illam</foreign> was misread as <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >in</foreign> (as was mentioned above), or perhaps — after the loss of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">et hanc</foreign> — <foreign xml:lang="la">urbem</foreign> was
                  added as a gloss for the now lonely <foreign xml:lang="la">illam</foreign> based
                  on an antithesis with <foreign xml:lang="la">in oppido</foreign>.</p>

               <p>With these repairs the sentence reads:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">Perfectis enim magna ex parte munitionibus in oppido,
                     <supplied reason="lost">et hanc</supplied> et illam <surplus>urbem</surplus>
                  uno tempore temptari posse confidebat.</quote>

               <quote rend="blockquote">For since he had mostly completed his works in the town, he
                  was confident that an attempt could be made on both the latter (<hi rend="italic"
                     >sc</hi>. the jetty) and the former (<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. the island) at
                  the same time.</quote>

               <p>As the narrative continues, Caesar attacks the island (17–18) then the jetty
                  (19–21). This does not square perfectly with <foreign xml:lang="la">uno
                     tempore</foreign>, but the misfit is at least partly a result of the gaps in
                  the narrative in the following sentence and at 17.6.</p>

               <p>The second gap pertains to the two-pronged attack itself. In the passage as
                  transmitted we hear that Caesar, hoping to split the enemy force, sent decked
                  ships to attack one part of the island, and that he encouraged the men in his own
                  divided force to compete with one another for the rewards that would be given to
                  whichever group first took control of the island: </p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">In alteram insulae partem distinendae manus causa constratis
                  nauibus aggreditur praemiis magnis propositis qui primus insulam cepisset.</quote>

               <p>The construction <foreign xml:lang="la">in … insulae partem … aggreditur</foreign>
                  is problematic — although for a similar anacoluthon see 26.2 — but the bigger
                  problem here is the absence of any reference to the other part of the island,
                  presumably the part that the large force of men (ten cohorts plus light infantry
                  and select cavalry, presumably on foot) embarked on the smaller vessels and skiffs
                  was to attack. Since this area is the focus of the main battle narrative starting
                  at 17.5, its omission here is odd.</p>

               <p><ref target="#Aldus">Aldus</ref> repaired the smaller problem by excising the
                  unwanted preposition, <ref target="#Oudendorp">Oudendorp</ref> by converting it

                     >Vascosanus</ref>, who accepted Aldus’ emendation, addressed the larger problem
                  by adding a connective before <foreign xml:lang="la">alteram</foreign> and

                     presupposes the loss of <foreign xml:lang="la">-que</foreign>, which may be

                     later in the sentence: praemiis <hi rend="italic">ed. pr.</hi> : praemiisque

               </quote>

               <p><ref target="#Castiglioni">Castiglioni</ref> combined the two approaches,
                  replacing <foreign xml:lang="la">in</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="la"

               <quote rend="blockquote">… cohortes X … in nauigia minora scaphasque imponit et

               <p>With both repairs the fact that the ten cohorts (etc.) make an attack elsewhere
                  has to be deduced from <foreign xml:lang="la">alteram</foreign>. The innovations
                  implicit in these repairs are not impossible, but they are not particularly
                  plausible, either. Furthermore, there are no good parallels for the elision of the
                  second <foreign xml:lang="la">alter</foreign>- in the corpus. The closest is 1.5
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">ex altera oppidi parte auxilia ferri posset</foreign>,
                  but there the solo <foreign xml:lang="la">altera</foreign> depends on the
                  preceding <foreign xml:lang="la">in duas partes esset urbs diuisa</foreign>.<note
                     place="foot">Similarly 34.3 <hi rend="italic">legiones … duas … quarum
                        altera</hi>. The closest parallel for our passage is probably <hi
                        rend="italic">BG</hi> 7.44.3–4, but there the reference of the solo <hi
                        rend="italic">ad alteram oppidi partem</hi> is defined by contrast with
                     Caesar’s own position.</note>
               </p>

               <p>Another approach is to assume another eye-skip here resulting in a lacuna that one
                  might fill thus:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">… cohortes X … in nauigia minora scaphasque imponit. In
                  alteram insulae partem <supplied reason="lost">pedestres copias exponit, alteram
                     partem</supplied> distinendae manus causa constratis nauibus aggreditur
                  praemiis magnis propositis qui primus insulam cepisset.</quote>

               <p>This supplement makes use of the transmitted preposition <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >in</foreign> and provides a second <foreign xml:lang="la">alteram</foreign>,
                  thereby specifying the attack’s two approaches, which the enemies withstand
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">pariter</foreign> in 17.4 (<foreign xml:lang="la">ac
                     primo impetum nostrorum pariter sustinuerunt</foreign>). Its language has
                  acceptable parallels, too, since Incertus uses the expression <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">copiae pedestres</foreign> twice, once in an antithesis with
                  naval forces (44.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">partim classe per se, partim pedestribus
                     copiis per barbaros</foreign>, cf. also 64.1), and mentions troop landings
                  twice (10.2 <hi rend="italic">remiges in terram … exposuisset</hi>, 19.3 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">cohortium instar in terram exposuerat</foreign>). But at least
                  two aspects of the supplement give pause. First, the hypothesized skip goes from
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">partem</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >partem</foreign>, yet the second <foreign xml:lang="la">partem</foreign> is
                  unnecessary and probably unwanted: in comparable constructions Incertus omits the
                  second substantive (1.5 <foreign xml:lang="la">alterius rei … alterius</foreign>,
                  11.4 <foreign xml:lang="la">una hostium triremis … altera</foreign>, 19.5 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">altero opere effecto … alter instituto</foreign>, 28.3 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">unum latus … alterum</foreign>). However, the pleonasm is
                  paralleled at <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 1.2.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">una ex parte
                     … altera ex parte</foreign> (cf. also <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 4.3.3). Second,
                  one misses the connective provided by earlier repairs. So the supplement can only
                  be offered <foreign xml:lang="la">exempli gratia</foreign>.</p>

               <p>On balance, however, it seems better to indicate a gap than to apply a superficial
                  repair.</p>

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">incensi … ut</foreign>. His explanation for the genesis
                  of this long stretch of text is not particularly plausible, however, and the shift
                  of sequence is paralleled at Suet. <hi rend="italic">Tib</hi>. 50.1 (<foreign
                     xml:lang="la">Iuliae uxori tantum afuit ut relegatae … offici aut humanitatis

                  Suet. <hi rend="italic">Vesp</hi>. 14.1). <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Afuerunt</foreign> remains anomalous, but it is hard to believe that so
                  strange a usage arose as a gloss or scribal emendation. It is best left alone.</p>

               <p>The principal problem here is obvious: the middle sentence does not have a main
                  clause. Nor can its pieces easily be attached to what precedes or follows. The
                  prior sentence concerns Roman attacks on Alexandrian positions, while the sentence
                  under consideration involves Alexandrian sallies. The following sentence is a
                  general assessment of the situation: Caesar’s men were dangerously eager to fight.
                  The lacuna (on which see further below) creates uncertainty about what <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">quandocumque fors obtulerat</foreign> modifies: the closest
                  verbal forms pertain to the Alexandrians (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >procurrentibus</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la">erumpentibus</foreign>), but
                  the context is about Roman risk-taking, so it seems more likely to modify a verb
                  in the lacuna.<note place="foot">Thus <ref target="#Carter">Carter</ref> 1997:
                     “In the daily encounters, whenever the occasion offered, when the Alexandrians

                     for bracketing here. For the adjective, there are a few examples (e.g., <hi

                  mean “band” here (see further below), it seems more likely to refer to one of the

                  first lacuna to govern <foreign xml:lang="la">manum</foreign>, which now refers to
                  combat, not troops:</p>

                  militum.</quote>

               <p>The sense is good, the expression, although more Livian than Caesarian, does occur
                  in the corpus (71.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">ut celerius omnium opinione manum
                     consereret</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.21.3), and the lacuna can be
                  explained as originating in an eye-skip from <foreign xml:lang="la">con</foreign>-
                  to <foreign xml:lang="la">com</foreign>-. As for the remaining words, <ref
                     target="#Nipperdey">Nipperdey</ref> suggested that the first three originated
                  in something like <foreign xml:lang="la">Caesar comprehendi multum operibus
                     noluit</foreign>. This required the second lacuna shown above, to separate
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">operibus</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >studiis</foreign>, since the latter makes no sense with <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >comprehendi</foreign>. <ref target="#Nipperdey">Nipperdey</ref>’s text is
                  accepted by subsequent editors, including <ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref> and
                     <ref target="#Andrieu">Andrieu</ref>. However, his explanation of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">comprehendi multum operibus</foreign> seems unlikely, in that the
                  most recently mentioned <foreign xml:lang="la">opera</foreign> were protecting the
                  Alexandrians, not Caesar. Furthermore, it would be nice to have one problem spot
                  instead of two. So it is worth trying to come up with a better explanation for the
                  words after <ref target="#Nipperdey">Nipperdey</ref>’s first lacuna.</p>

               <p>The expression <foreign xml:lang="la">quandocumque fors</foreign>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">obtulerant</foreign>, with its pluperfect verb, suggests
                  that verb in the lacuna will be an imperfect indicative (cf., e.g., <hi

                     target="#Nipperdey">Nipperdey</ref>’s participle therefore, we might try:</p>

                  <supplied reason="lost"><foreign xml:lang="la">conserere
                     optabant</foreign></supplied> (cf. Hirt. 8.41.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">hoc
                     fonte prohiberi posse oppidanos cum optarent reliqui</foreign>, from a passage
                  that has much in common with the one under consideration and will be cited again
                  below). Or:</p>

               <p>2) <foreign xml:lang="la">manum</foreign>
                  <supplied reason="lost"><foreign xml:lang="la">conserendam

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">conclamant omnes occasionem negotii bene gerendi
                     amittendam non esse, ad castra iri oportere</foreign>)</p>

               <p>Neither is quite right in a sentence that begins <foreign xml:lang="la">In
                     proeliis cotidianis</foreign>. Better:</p>

                  <supplied reason="lost"><foreign xml:lang="la">conserere
                     properabant</foreign></supplied> (cf. 20.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">naues … a
                     terra repellere properabant</foreign>).<note place="foot">In place of
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">properabant</foreign> one could supply <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">contendebant</foreign>, which also takes a complementary
                     infinitive (e.g., <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 3.15.1 <hi rend="italic">milites …
                        transcendere in hostium naues contendebant … barbari … fuga salutem petere
                        contendebant</hi>, cf. <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.58.1), but the imperfect
                     is less common in this construction than the perfect.</note></p>

               <p>If the lacuna did originate in an eye-skip, it is difficult to determine its
                  length. But the words that come after the lacuna provide some clues as to its
                  contents.</p>

               <p>1) If we make Caesarian soldiers the subject of the verb in the lacuna, we also
                  need something that changes the subject, or at least the focalization, since these
                  eager soldiers are later referred to in the genitive (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >ardentibus studiis militum</foreign>). In the Hirtius passage just mentioned
                  (8.41.2), which continues <foreign xml:lang="la">Caesar unus uideret</foreign>
                     (<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign xml:lang="la">eos prohiberi
                     posse</foreign>), the focalization shifts from <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >reliqui</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la">Caesar</foreign>, as it often does
                  in passages in which Caesar overrules the impetuous desires of his men (e.g., <hi
                     rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.71–72 <foreign xml:lang="la">id … ex omnibus partibus
                     ab eo flagitabatur … Caesar in eam spem uenerat se sine pugna et sine uulnere
                     suorum rem conficere posse</foreign>; cf. <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 6.34.7, <hi
                     rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.74.2–3, <hi rend="italic">BAfr</hi> 82.2–3 and, with
                  the roles reversed, <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.64.2–3).</p>

               <p>2) The infinitive <foreign xml:lang="la">comprehendi</foreign> needs a subject and
                  something to govern it. For the former, the most likely candidates are people (cf.
                  55.1, <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 4.27.3, etc.) or places (cf. <hi rend="italic"
                     >BC</hi> 3.46.6 <foreign xml:lang="la">aliis comprehensis
                     collibus</foreign>).<note place="foot">The passages in which <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">comprehendi</foreign> is used of things catching fire do not
                     seem to offer any way to use <foreign xml:lang="la">operibus</foreign>, let
                     alone <foreign xml:lang="la">ardentibus studiis</foreign>: <hi rend="italic"
                        >BG</hi> 5.43.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">hae</foreign> (sc. <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">casae</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="la">celeriter ignem
                        comprehenderunt</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.101.4 <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">flamma ab utroque cornu comprehensa naues sunt combustae
                        quinque</foreign>, Hirt. 8.43.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">opera flamma
                        comprehensa partim restinguunt, partim interscindunt</foreign>.</note> When
                  applied to people the verb usually means “round up and put under arrest,” which
                  does not suit the present passage, but <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.65.2 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">cuius aduentus Pompeianos compressit nostrosque
                     firmauit</foreign> offers a parallel for the meaning “check,” which might work.
                  However, the verb’s use with places also suits the situation on the ground in
                  Alexandria: Caesar’s objective is not to encircle the Alexandrians with defensive
                  works but to increase the space that he himself controls by building defensive
                  works around it (cf. <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.112.7 <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Caesar loca maxime necessaria complexus noctu praemuniit</foreign><note
                     place="foot">The strategy announced here plays out in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bellum Alexandrinum</hi>, which shows him taking control of the palace area
                     first (1.2–5, esp. <foreign xml:lang="la">munitiones cotidie operibus
                        augentur</foreign>), then Pharos Island and the Heptastadion (17.1–2,
                     19–21).</note> ); he is trying to keep his men safe until reinforcements arrive
                     (<hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.112.5–6, <hi rend="italic">BAlex</hi> 1.1–2), as
                  they will do shortly (28.1–2). As for what governs <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >comprehendi</foreign>, the possibilities are obviously numerous.</p>

               <p>3) The phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">operibus atque ardentibus studiis</foreign>
                  needs to be made plausible. At present <foreign xml:lang="la">operibus</foreign>
                  most naturally refers to the Alexandrian fortifications just mentioned (<foreign
                     xml:lang="la">in expugnandis operibus</foreign>), which make an awkward pair
                  with the enthusiasm of Roman soldiers. If, however, the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >opera</foreign> are Roman and parallel to the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >studia</foreign>, as <foreign xml:lang="la">laborem aut pugnandi poterat
                     cupiditatem</foreign> in the following sentence suggests, the phrase here is
                  oddly imbalanced.<note place="foot">For the combination of morale and effort cf.
                     Hirt. 8.41.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">non deterrentur tamen milites nostri vineas
                        proferre et labore atque operibus locorum vincere
                     difficultates</foreign>.</note></p>

               <p>4) The mysterious <foreign xml:lang="la">diuulgata</foreign> in the following
                  sentence needs a textual anchor; at present it is hard to see anything that it
                  might refer to, since the previously mentioned Caesarian exhortations mentioned
                  occurred in earlier battles, one a success (15.5), one a failure (20.1, 21.1). It
                  ought to point to something that Caesar says in this episode, something that
                  aligns with the resulting <foreign xml:lang="la">labor</foreign> and <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">pugnandi cupiditas</foreign>, and can perhaps be located in the
                  word that governs <foreign xml:lang="la">comprehendi</foreign>.</p>

               <p>So one might fill the lacuna thus, <foreign xml:lang="la">exempli
                  gratia</foreign>:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">In proeliis cotidianis, quandocumque fors obtulerat,
                  procurrentibus et erumpentibus Alexandrinis, manum <supplied reason="lost"
                     >conserere properabant omnes, Caesar autem contendebat hostes (<foreign
                        xml:lang="la">or</foreign> loca illa) posse</supplied> comprehendi multum
                  operibus et ardentibus studiis militum. Nec diuulgata Caesaris hortatio subsequi
                  legionum aut laborem aut pugnandi poterat cupiditatem, ut magis deterrendi et
                  continendi a periculosissimis essent dimicationibus quam incitandi ad
                  pugnandum.</quote>

               <p>This is a minimalist stopgap; the lacuna might be longer. Caesar’s repeated
                  utterance (<foreign xml:lang="la">contendebat</foreign>) is (a gesture towards)
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">diuulgata hortatio</foreign> desiderated above.<note
                     place="foot">For <foreign xml:lang="la">contendere</foreign> with a dependent

                     suggested here is rather implausible as it stands—Caesar and his soldiers do
                     not usually squabble over strategy on the field of battle—but that is perhaps
                     due to its abbreviation. (For a one-time squabble, however, see the peculiar
                     opening of the battle of Thapsus: <hi rend="italic">BAfr</hi> 82.2–3 Cum idem a

                     to redouble their efforts to retake the fortifications on the bridge instead of
                     fighting outside the fortifications, and followed this up with the explanation
                     in the text.</note> But there remains (at least) one fly in the ointment: the

                     <ptr target="#stba22.2-multum"/>). What we really want is a modifier for

               <p>The verbal parallel is not perfect but the sense is decent and there is a similar

                  second lacuna is in the wrong place and may not be necessary. The remaining

               <p>1. Paragraph 26 of the <title>Bellum Alexandrinum</title> presents four primary
                  difficulties, all indicated by problems of syntax or style rather than by
                  discrepancies in the manuscript tradition: first, the tense of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign>, which stands alone as a present-tense verb
                  amid perfect-tense verbs both in the previous section and in the following clauses
                  of paragraph 26; second, the absolute usage of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adducit</foreign>, which is found in all the manuscripts but not used
                  absolutely in an active form elsewhere in the Caesarian corpus; third, the strange
                  placement and syntax of <foreign xml:lang="la">Achillae</foreign>, a proper noun
                  that contributes little except a reminder of the identity of the enemy in the
                  passage (and, because of this mnemonic value, may have originated as a helpful
                  gloss provided by a later hand); fourth, the difficult phrase <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">multiplici praesidio</foreign>, which must either be understood
                  in a <foreign xml:lang="la">constructio ad sensum</foreign> as an ablative
                  absolute with a plural participle <foreign xml:lang="la">propugnantibus</foreign>
                  or be suspected as a gloss.</p>

               <p>The present tense of <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign>, upon first
                  analysis, appears problematic because of the perfect-tense verbs that both precede
                  and follow the verb and enmesh it within a narrative of perfective aspect;
                  additionally, <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> is linked to the subsequent
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">redegit</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >collocauit</foreign> by the conjunction -<foreign xml:lang="la">que</foreign>,
                  which typically joins balanced or parallel elements.<note place="foot">It should
                     be noted that, although the punctuation of this edition of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Bellum Alexandrinum</hi> separates paragraph 26 into two
                     distinct sentences and includes a full stop after <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >adducit</foreign>, the close connection between the verbs indicated by the
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">idque</foreign> and the desired balance between
                     tenses within the paragraph remains. Other editions, including that of <ref
                        target="#Aldus">Aldus</ref>, have presented this entire passage as a single
                     sentence. On the punctuation policy applied here see
                     <!-- What is Damon 2015a? -->Damon 2015a, lxv–lxvi.</note>
                  <ref target="#Aldus">Aldus</ref>, therefore, emended the verb to <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">adduxit</foreign>; one may cite as a parallel <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">adduxit</foreign> at 43.4, where it appears in a nexus of other
                  perfect-tense verbs.</p>

               <p>However, a parallel for the mixture of tenses linked by a -<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >que</foreign> is found elsewhere within the <hi rend="italic">Bellum
                     Alexandrinum</hi>, as for example at 61.4:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">Hunc Marcellus insequitur et quam proxime potest Vliam
                  castra castris confert locorumque cognita natura, quo maxime rem deducere uolebat
                  necessitate est deductus, ut neque confligeret—cuius si rei facultas esset,
                  resistere incitatis militibus non poterat—neque uagari Cassium latius pateretur,
                  ne plures ciuitates ea paterentur quae passi erant Cordubenses.</quote>

               <p>Both <foreign xml:lang="la">insequitur</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >confert</foreign> are present-tense main verbs, and they are linked—after an
                  ablative absolute and a relative clause—by a -<foreign xml:lang="la">que</foreign>
                  with the perfect passive <foreign xml:lang="la">est deductus</foreign>, clearly in
                  secondary sequence as it is followed by imperfect subjunctives.</p>

               <p>But why the mixture of tenses? For paragraph 26, the most probable explanation is
                  the vividness of the present tense, which complements the dramatic staging of the
                  introductory phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">sub idem tempus</foreign>. This same
                  opening hook is used five times in the <title>Bellum Alexandrinum</title> (at
                  26.1, 28.1, 40.1, 42.1, 64.2), and two of these passages have clear present-tense
                  verbs (28.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">proficiscitur</foreign>, 40.1 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">concurritur</foreign>), one includes an ambiguous form (64.2
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">uenit</foreign>), and one a perfect passive (42.1
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">acceptum est</foreign>). In those cases where <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">sub idem tempus</foreign> introduces a verb of present (or
                  potentially-present) tense, the surrounding sentences include a medley of perfect
                  and imperfect tense verbs, as occurs in paragraph 26. Additionally, <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign>, being itself a verb of motion, seems to have a
                  kinship with the first three examples of the present/potentially-present variety,
                  offering the action anticipated by the opening phrase.</p>

               <p>There is clearly, then, no problem with the <foreign xml:lang="la">tense</foreign>
                  of <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> in this passage, and <ref
                     target="#Aldus">Aldus</ref>' emendation may be set aside, though it remains a
                  helpful diagnostic emendation.</p>

               <p>2. The next problem likewise centers upon <hi rend="italic">adducit</hi>, but is a
                  matter of syntax not tense. The verb <hi rend="italic">adduco</hi> is inherently
                     transitive<note place="foot">Present forms of the simplex verb <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">duco</foreign> do occur in Latin literature absolutely with
                     directional constructions, wherein the context is a military general leading
                     his troops (<hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. <hi rend="italic">TLL</hi>
                     5.1.2142.30–50). Two examples may be provided from Livy: 1.23.5 <foreign

                        <foreign xml:lang="la">adduco</foreign> is a compound of this verb, the <hi

                  43.4, 58.1, 62.1, 68.1). The present sentence lacks a direct object to complete
                  the sense of <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign>. The ablative of
                  accompaniment <foreign xml:lang="la">cum magnis copiis</foreign> demonstrates that
                  Mithridates was not proceeding towards Egypt alone, but does not fulfill the need
                  of the verb <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> for an object. Various

                  primarily taken two paths: the first method is to alter the verb <foreign

                  in such a way as to provide the verb with a direct object.</p>

               <p>The following four emendations adapt the syntax according to the first method.</p>

               <p>a. <ref target="#Dauisius1727">Davisius</ref>, in his second edition of 1727,
                  first suggested that <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> be replaced with
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">aduenit</foreign>, an intransitive verb. This suggestion
                  was followed by both <ref target="#Schneider">Schneider</ref> (1888) and <ref
                     target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref> (1927), and is attractive for its simplicity, but
                  it must be noted that <foreign xml:lang="la">aduenio</foreign> is not found as a
                  finite verb in the <title>Bellum Alexandrinum</title>, and is only found twice in
                  participial form (32.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">dignum adueniens fructum uirtutis et
                     animi magnitudinis tulit</foreign> and, later in the same passage, <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">aduenienti Caesari occurrerunt seque ei dediderunt</foreign>). In
                  neither of these instances is a destination designated, although parallel—albeit,
                  again, participial—forms of <foreign xml:lang="la">aduenio</foreign> with
                  attendant accusatives of place do appear at Liu. 42.56.3 (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >M. Lucretius, Chalcidem adueniens … nuntium, praetoris uerbis qui abscedere
                     eum inde iuberet, misit</foreign>) and 44.30.9 (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Carauantium in Cauiis Durnium oppidum aduenientem benigne accepit</foreign>;
                  see further <hi rend="italic">TLL</hi> 1.831.40–50). Overall, participial forms
                  are far more common in the Caesarian corpus (participial forms occurring at <hi
                     rend="italic">BC</hi> 2.32.12, twice at <hi rend="italic">BAlex</hi> 32.3, <hi
                     rend="italic">BAfr</hi> 11.2, 23.2, 74.2, 89.2; only once in a finite form at
                     <hi rend="italic">BAfr</hi> 7.3). The infrequency of this verb with an
                  accusative of destination, as well as the apparent preference for the verb in its
                  participial form, together justify editors in continuing to search for alternative
                  solutions.</p>

               <p>b. <ref target="#Vielhaber1869">Vielhaber</ref>’s emendation, though made over a
                  century later, closely corresponds with that of <ref target="#Dauisius1727"
                     >Davisius</ref>, and thus should be treated next. He emended the text to read
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">ad Pelusium uenit</foreign>, arguing that there was a
                  transposition of the preposition <foreign xml:lang="la">ad</foreign>, which later
                  led to a misconstrual of the verb: <foreign xml:lang="la">ad Pelusium
                     uenit</foreign> became <foreign xml:lang="la">Pelusium ad uenit</foreign> and,
                  because the verb <foreign xml:lang="la">uenit</foreign> would have been
                  abbreviated as <foreign xml:lang="la">uēit</foreign>, the text would resemble
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">Pelusium aduēit</foreign>, easily (mis)read as “<foreign
                     xml:lang="la">Pelusium aducit</foreign>.” <ref target="#Vielhaber1869"
                     >Vielhaber</ref> cited 36.3 as a model for this passage (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >magnis et continuis itineribus confectis cum aduentaret ad
                  Nicopolim</foreign>). His paleographic explanation is appealing, and, like <ref
                     target="#Dauisius1727">Davisius’</ref>, his suggested emendation neatly
                  sidesteps the lack of direct object by replacing it <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adducit</foreign> with an intransitive verb.</p>

               <p>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Venit</foreign> is, additionally, far more common in the
                     <title>Bellum Alexandrinum</title> than <ref target="#Dauisius1727"
                     >Davisius’</ref>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">aduenit</foreign>, and is found in finite and infinitive
                  forms twenty times in the text, and in participial forms three further times.
                  Parallels from elsewhere in the text that can be used in support of <ref
                     target="#Vielhaber1869">Vielhaber</ref>’s emendation include 62.1, where the
                  ablative of accompaniment <foreign xml:lang="la">cum copiis</foreign> shares the
                  same function as in this paragraph (<foreign xml:lang="la">paucis diebus Q. Cassi
                     litteris acceptis rex Bogus cum copiis uenit</foreign>), and 25.5, where
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">uenit</foreign> is used with <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >ad</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="la">cum ad Canopum uentum
                  esset</foreign>).</p>

               <p><ref target="#Vielhaber1869">Vielhaber</ref>’s emendation does depend on a
                  two-step error and on the superfluous inclusion of the preposition <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">ad</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="la">Pelusium</foreign>, an
                  unnecessary word despite the parallel at 25.5. Indeed, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >uenit</foreign> is used with a designated destination without a linking
                  preposition at 63.1: … <foreign xml:lang="la">et reliquorum auxiliorum uenit ea
                     mente Vliam ut sine ullo studio contentiones Cassii Marcellique

                     regarding the superfluity of prepositions with proper names of cities with

                     the <hi rend="italic">Bellum Alexandrinum</hi> is somewhat inconsistent in this
                     grammatical construction. At 58.1, <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> is
                     used with the preposition <foreign xml:lang="la">ad Cordubam</foreign>; at
                     42.4, <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> is used with <foreign

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">Macedoniam</foreign>, reflecting the use of a
                     preposition to advancement within a country (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >AG</foreign> 428c). Similarly, variations and inconsistencies exist within
                     the Caesarian corpus. <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.36.4, <hi rend="italic"
                        >BC</hi> 1.36.5, <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.61.5, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >BC</hi> 3.80.4.2 offer forms of <foreign xml:lang="la">adduco</foreign>
                     with destinations without separate prepositions; <hi rend="italic">BG</hi>
                     1.43.3, <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 2.1.3, and <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 4.18.4,
                     on the other hand, combine forms of <foreign xml:lang="la">adduco</foreign>
                     with an iterated <foreign xml:lang="la">ad</foreign>; whereas <hi rend="italic"
                        >BG</hi> 4.36.2 and <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 5.46.3 mix the passive
                     infinitive <foreign xml:lang="la">adduci</foreign> with the preposition
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">in</foreign>).</note> Furthermore, the fact that
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">aduenio</foreign> appears in the Corpus, if only in
                  participial forms, is a deterrent to emending it out of the present passage.</p>

               <p>c. <ref target="#Fleischer">Fleischer</ref> proposed <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Pelusium</foreign>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">accedit</foreign>, and cited four parallels from the <hi
                     rend="italic">Bellum Alexandrinum</hi> of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >accedo</foreign> used with an accusative of destination without a preposition:
                  37.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">Domitius postero die propius Nicopolin accessit
                     castraque oppido contulit</foreign>, 38.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">propiusque
                     ipse Alexandriam per Syriam accederet</foreign>, 56.6 <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >ipse classem quam parabat ut inspiceret, Hispalim accedit ibique
                     moratur</foreign>, 67.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">cum propius Pontum finesque
                     Gallograeciae accessisset</foreign>. Though the number of parallels seems
                  impressive, <ref target="#Fleischer">Fleischer</ref> himself notes that three of
                  his examples include the adverb <foreign xml:lang="la">propius</foreign>, while
                  paragraph 26 does not.</p>

               <p>d. A more radical repair to the verb that attempted to emend the problems of tense
                  and syntax was proposed by <ref target="#Hoffmann1890">Hoffmann</ref>, who altered
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adductis</foreign> and excised <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign>, resulting
                  in the following:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote"> Sub idem tempus Mithridates Pergamenus … missus in Syriam
                  Ciliciamque initio belli Alexandrini ad auxilia arcessenda, magnis copiis, quas
                  celeriter et propensissima civitatum uoluntate et sua diligentia confecerat,
                  itinere pedestri, quo coniungitur Aegyptus Syriae, Pelusium adductis, id oppidum
                  firmo praesidio occupatum Achillae propter opportunitatem loci … in suam redegit
                  potestatem praesidiumque ibi suum collocauit.</quote>

               <p>This is, as is made clear from the text above, a three-part emendation: 1. <ref
                     target="#Hoffmann1890">Hoffmann</ref> deleted the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >cum</foreign> of <foreign xml:lang="la">cum magnis copiis</foreign>, 2. he
                  emended <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adductis</foreign> (a reasonable transposition), and 3. he deleted the
                     -<foreign xml:lang="la">que</foreign> of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >idque</foreign>, reducing the number of finite, indicative verbs in this lengthy
                  sentence to two and the number of -<foreign xml:lang="la">que</foreign>’s to one.
                  The distribution of these emendations, which requires a number of small errors to
                  coordinate throughout the passage, makes his suggestion less likely; the great
                  separation between <foreign xml:lang="la">magnis copiis</foreign> and <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">propugnantibus</foreign>, forty-six words apart from one another,
                  is another reason to doubt Hoffmann's emendation. Yet the repair is worth
                  consideration because, although with each intervention his proposal becomes more
                  unlikely, each individual emendation is plausible and his overall approach to
                  altering the verb is of a completely different character from those that preceded
                  him.</p>

               <p>There are also emendations that resolve the difficult syntax of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> without altering the form of the verb, three of
                  which are discussed below.</p>

               <p>e. <ref target="#Vascosanus">Vascosanus</ref> replaced <foreign xml:lang="la">cum
                     magnis copiis</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="la">magnas copias</foreign>;
                     <ref target="#Stephanus">Stephanus</ref> made the same emendation almost
                  simultaneously. The emendation is based upon the overall sense of the passage: the
                  ablative of accompaniment makes it clear that it is (at least in part) the
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">copiae</foreign> that Mithridates led into Asia, so the
                  deletion of <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign> and modification of the cases of
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">magnis copiis</foreign> simplifies this complex
                  sentence. But this emendation, too, requires a two-step corruption, wherein first
                  the accusatives shifted to ablatives, then <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign>
                  was inserted (or the same steps in reverse order); these changes could have
                  occurred accidentally through transcription (though there is no nearby <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">cum</foreign> that could have resulted in dittography), or the
                  distance between the accusative and its transitive verb could have led a
                  particularly intrusive scribe to alter the text to its detriment. Distance alone,
                  however, was little enough cause to prompt such an innovation, as it is unclear
                  why the ablative of accompaniment would have been inserted in place of the
                  accusative.</p>

               <p>f. <!-- Which Landgraf 1891? -->Landgraf in 1891 chose not to alter the paradosis
                  at all, but rather to justify the anomalous use of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adducit</foreign> by means of anacoluthon. Landgraf explains the lack of a
                  direct object for <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> as an error original to
                  the text resulting from the ungainly length of the sentence, which resulted either
                  in the author’s losing track of the syntax of his sentence or choosing rather to
                  start again with emphasis—a subtle distinction that either demeans the style of
                  the author of the <title>Bellum Alexandrinum</title> or underscores its similarity
                  to other prose works incorporating rhetorical figures. This is an attractive
                  solution, as it requires no alteration of the text at all, and can be used to
                  explain the rambling structure of this sentence with logic rather than by assuming
                  random clumsiness of the author and ignorance of all subsequent scribes and
                  readers. Even with anacoluthon, however, the verb <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adducit</foreign> strongly desires a direct object, even if only a resumptive
                  deictic hearkening back to the ablative of accompaniment.</p>

               <p>g. Following upon Landgraf’s supposition of anacoluthon, it is additionally
                  possible, and, indeed, my suggested emendation, that there is a lacuna of one or
                  more words before the verb <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> that included
                  its original direct object. The grammatical problem of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >adducit</foreign> is subtle enough that no subsequent scribe would necessarily
                  suspect a lost direct object, or indeed look for or supply a correction. The sheer
                  length of the sentence is a likely cause for such an omission: <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> occurs only at the conclusion of the long
                  opening sentence; a lacuna may indeed have arisen precisely because of the string
                  of genitives, participial phrases, and relative clauses that in the end masks the
                  syntactic trouble with <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign>.</p>

               <p>It is possible that the lacuna included a number of troops, or a military unit
                  such as a legion (cf. the list of troops provided at <hi rend="italic">BC</hi>
                  3.4.3–6). Mithridates, although a Pergamene, may have led legions alongside the
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">copiae</foreign> he had rallied together; something
                  similar occurs at 62.1 (<foreign xml:lang="la">rex Bogus cum copiis uenit
                     adiungitque ei legioni quam secum adduxerat conplures cohortes auxiliarias
                     Hispanorum</foreign>). Likewise, commonly abbreviated words, such as <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">nostros</foreign> or deictics such as <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >eas</foreign>, could easily have been lost. A lacuna doesn’t fix everything,
                  of course, since anacoluthon is still present.</p>

               <p>3. The third problem in this passage is the word <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Achillae</foreign>, which, in form, could be either a genitive or a dative,
                  and is problematic both in syntax and in its position within the sentence. There
                  are two possible grammatical functions served by this word: either it is a dative
                  of agency with the perfect passive participle <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >occupatum</foreign> (uncommon and therefore unlikely), or it is a possessive
                  genitive depending on <foreign xml:lang="la">praesidio</foreign>. The latter is a
                  more likely reading, but the intervening word <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >occupatum</foreign> makes for an awkward word order.</p>

               <p>The name Achillas only occurs two other times in the <hi rend="italic">Bellum
                     Alexandrinum</hi>, and here the word serves only to remind the reader of the
                  identity of the stronghold’s leader. Achillas himself plays no direct role in the
                  action of the passage. The possibility must therefore be entertained that <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">Achillae</foreign> was supplied by a scribe as a gloss on the
                  text. We therefore suggest excision as a possible repair.</p>

               <p>4. The final problem involves the unusual phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">multiplici
                     praesidio</foreign>. As with <foreign xml:lang="la">adducit</foreign> above,
                  the issue is not one of confusion within the manuscripts, for <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">multiplici praesidio</foreign> is undisputedly the parodosis.
                  Suspicion arises, however, because of the seeming tautology that arises if
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">propugnantibus</foreign> is construed with <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">copiis</foreign> as a drawn-out ablative absolute with a
                  repetitive phrase contained within it. The phrase <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >multiplici praesidio</foreign> complicates the surrounding ablative phrase
                  without, at first glance, contributing additional information about the
                  fighting—we have already been informed by <foreign xml:lang="la">magnis …
                     copiis</foreign> that there are a large number of troops fighting. So, if we
                  read <foreign xml:lang="la">copiis</foreign> as the noun of the ablative absolute
                  in agreement with <foreign xml:lang="la">propugnantibus</foreign>, <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">multiplici praesidio</foreign>, whether understood in apposition
                  or as a locative ablative, is superfluous—or, at the very least, the term <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">multiplici</foreign> is. At <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.69.4 one
                  finds the ablative <foreign xml:lang="la">praesidio</foreign> used as a locative
                  within an ablative absolute (… <foreign xml:lang="la">atque omnes copiae paucis
                     praesidio relictis cohortibus exeunt rectoque ad Hiberum itinere
                     contendunt</foreign>), but <foreign xml:lang="la">multiplex</foreign> occurs
                  nowhere else in the Caesarian corpus. <ref target="#Gemoll">Gemoll</ref> therefore
                  proposed that <foreign xml:lang="la">multiplici praesidio</foreign> should be
                  removed, arguing that it was inserted into the text as a gloss. <ref
                     target="#Gemoll">Gemoll</ref> is correct in positing that <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">multiplici praesidio</foreign> provides little additional
                  information: yet the fact that the phrase supplies no necessary data can also be
                  used to rebut the probability of this phrase acting as a gloss in the first place.
                  Glosses are meant to provide helpful information to a reader, not repeat what is
                  already stated in a synonymous phrase; thus no scholarly scribe would find the
                  need or desire to add it in the first place.</p>

               <p>But Landgraf (1888) defended the parodosis, retaining the phrase <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">multiplici praesidio</foreign> but construing it, not as a
                  parallel or subordinate detail to <foreign xml:lang="la">magnis copiis</foreign>,
                  but rather as the noun paired with the participle <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >propugnantibus</foreign> in the ablative absolute. <ref target="#Landgraf1888"
                     >Landgraf</ref> cited Liu. 32.32.4 as a parallel for <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >praesidium</foreign> used as a collective singular (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >arcem regium tenebat praesidium neque ut decederent inde aut Opuntiorum minui
                     aut auctoritate imperatoris Romani perpelli potuerunt</foreign>). Not only can
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">praesidium</foreign> function collectively, but <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">multiplex</foreign>, too, may do so, and one can complement
                  Landgraf’s defense with parallels elsewhere in Latin (see <hi rend="italic"
                     >TLL</hi> 8.1592.48–60 ‘spectat ad quantitatem,’ where this passage is listed
                  along with fourteen others).</p>

               <p>This interpretation resolves the matter, too, of the meaning of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">propugnantibus</foreign>, a <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >defensive</foreign> verb that generally means “to make a sortie” or “to go out
                  to fight,” often explicitly from walls or battlements. This is an action that
                  befits the troops of Achillas but not those of Mithridates, who are storming a
                  well guarded city, and thus we should not expect the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >copiae</foreign> (who belong to Mithridates) to be the subject of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">propugnantibus</foreign>. The meaning of the participle,
                  therefore, makes the ablative absolute extending from <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >magnis</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la">propugnantibus</foreign> unlikely,
                  and favors instead Landgraf’s explanation of the paradosis. Inserted in a sentence
                  about the operations of Mithridates’ troops, <foreign xml:lang="la">multiplici
                     praesidio pertinaciter propugnantibus</foreign> reminds the careful reader of
                  both sides of the battle and should be understood as an ablative absolute with
                  adversative force.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, although <foreign xml:lang="la">multiplex</foreign> is not found
                  elsewhere in the Caesarian corpus, the word itself is not uncommon word in
                  classical Latin,<note place="foot">A <hi rend="italic">Brepolis</hi> search, for
                     example, offers over nine hundred forms of the adjective from authors predating
                     500 CE, nearly two hundred of which belong to the classical period.</note> and
                  is found frequently in historical works by authors such as Sallust and Livy, as
                  well as in the philosophical works of Cicero. The term should not, therefore, be
                  omitted on stylistic grounds. It even echoes nicely the previous description of
                  Achillas’ <foreign xml:lang="la">praesidium</foreign> at the opening of the
                  sentence, where it is characterized as being “<foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >firmus</foreign>,” and the lengthy description at <hi rend="italic">BC</hi>
                  3.110.1–6. <foreign xml:lang="la">Multiplici,</foreign> then, is a lynchpin that
                  identifies the <foreign xml:lang="la">praesidium</foreign> as that of the enemy,
                  marks the opening of the concessive ablative absolute, and emphasizes the success
                  of Mithridates in this passage.</p>

               <p>The ungainly sentence presented by the paradosis here accumulated substantive
                  innovations in the process of transmission and has accordingly been the object of
                  a variety of interventions. As a first step towards establishing a text it will be
                  important to state the textual evidence clearly, since, as will soon become clear,
                  most editors have resorted to excision and consequently shown little interest in
                  the problems raised by the excised text.</p>

               <p>As transmitted in <hi rend="italic">MUTV</hi> the sentence contains a string of
                  five ablative constructions, whereas in <hi rend="italic">S</hi> there are only
                  three since the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">constantiaque uirtutum et
                     Alexandrinorum imprudentia</foreign> has been omitted. Another singular variant
                  occurs in <hi rend="italic">V</hi>, where the first ablative expression is
                  bracketed between the connecting relative and the subject: <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Quorum impetum magna cum prudentia Mithridates constantiaque</foreign> etc.
                  Finally, the noun in this first ablative expression, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >prudentia</foreign>, is transmitted in <hi rend="italic">ST</hi> alongside a
                  variant, <foreign xml:lang="la">potentia</foreign>, that must go back at least to
                  their common source, <hi rend="italic">nu</hi>, or perhaps all the way to the
                     archetype.<note place="foot">On variants in the archetype see Damon 2015b,
                     58–59. They are usually visible in the <hi rend="italic">mu</hi> family, not,
                     as here, in descendants of <hi rend="italic">nu</hi>.</note></p>

               <p>The version of the sentence found in <hi rend="italic">S</hi> appears in editions
                  from the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> onwards (the only early exception
                  is the edition of <ref target="#Beroaldus">Beroaldus</ref>, who prints the
                  paradosis). That is, it made its way into the vulgate long before <hi
                     rend="italic">S</hi> itself was used in the constitution of the text, via <hi
                     rend="italic">N</hi>, a descendant of <hi rend="italic">S</hi>; <ref
                     target="#Brown">Brown</ref> (1972, 48–49) describes the source of the <hi
                     rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> as a manuscript that contains “a text based
                  on a union of M and N … that was the basis of succeeding editions for nearly four
                  hundred years.” So although the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">constantiaque
                     uirtutum et Alexandrinorum imprudentia</foreign> has been confronting texts
                  that exclude it since the first time the readings of <hi rend="italic">M</hi> and
                     <hi rend="italic">N</hi> were joined in a single manuscript, only <ref
                     target="#Beroaldus">Beroaldus</ref> (1504) admitted it into the text. Nobody
                  wants it. The long string of ablatives is clumsy, and the juxtaposition of moral
                  terms such as <foreign xml:lang="la">prudentia</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >constantia</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="la">imprudentia</foreign> with
                  the matter-of-fact <foreign xml:lang="la">consuetudine nostra castris
                     uallatis</foreign> is jarring.</p>

               <p>Yet signs of disquiet percolate. Two of the variants mentioned above may originate
                  in purposeful innovations. The transposition in <hi rend="italic">V</hi> detaches
                  the moralizing ablatives from <foreign xml:lang="la">uallatis</foreign> and
                  applies them to the main clause, where they make better sense: <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">Quorum impetum magna cum prudentia Mithridates constantiaque
                     uirtutum et Alexandrinorum imprudentia … sustinuit</foreign> (cf. <hi
                     rend="italic">BG</hi> 7.10.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">impetum magno animo
                     sustineant</foreign>).<note place="foot">The frequently occurring expression
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">impetum sustinere</foreign> is accompanied by a
                     variety of modifiers in the <foreign xml:lang="la">corpus
                     Caesarianum</foreign>, but the <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> passage quoted above
                     is the only other example with a modal ablative, unless <hi rend="italic"
                        >BAlex</hi> 8.4 <foreign xml:lang="la">Magno negotio impetus hostium
                        aduersos ex munitionibus sustineri</foreign> counts as one.</note> Of course
                     <hi rend="italic">V</hi> has a habit of transposing words and phrases, and the
                  resulting word order does not always make sense, so one cannot be sure that the
                  transposition here is deliberate; it may have originated in an eye-skip from m- to
                     m-.<note place="foot">On transpositions in <hi rend="italic">V</hi> see <ref
                        target="#Damon2015b">Damon 2015b</ref>, 93 with note 183.</note> The
                  presence of <foreign xml:lang="la">potentia</foreign> is harder to explain. In a
                  phrase that modifies <foreign xml:lang="la">uallatis</foreign> it works even less
                  well than <foreign xml:lang="la">prudentia</foreign> does, and it works no better
                  with <foreign xml:lang="la">uirtutum</foreign>. Furthermore, it spoils the
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">prudentia/imprudentia</foreign> antithesis. Why is it
                  here? My best guess is that the innovation intended here was <foreign

                     >imprudentia</foreign>, and that <foreign xml:lang="la">potentia</foreign>

                  greedy haste of the Alexandrian troops in the preceding sentence (27.4 <foreign

                  <!-- Which one? -->Davies, too, reports the phrase as a manuscript variant—and
                  then condemns it as a gloss. He also, however, reports that <ref

                  significantly shorter and different version, <foreign xml:lang="la">constantiaque

                  This variant shines a spotlight on the awkwardness of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >uirtutum</foreign> in the supposed gloss. Good (or even adequate) parallels
                  for the plural and abstract genitive are hard to find. At <hi rend="italic"

                  of other spots), but it is not particularly close. When Incertus speaks of
                  Mithridates’ <foreign xml:lang="la">constantia oppugnandi</foreign> in the
                  preceding paragraph the dependent genitive is quite different: 26.2 <foreign

                  which the commander is given all the credit for a military success. But it is
                  quite hard to believe in an innovation that substitutes the problematic <foreign

                  string of innovations is implausibly elaborate. <ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref>
                  queries the relevance (and therefore likelihood) of the beginning of the supposed

                     in the movement of a substantial chunk of authentic text over the seventeen

                  >prudentia</foreign>, obviously, but for others we have to reach back to 26.2,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">perseuerantia constantiaque</foreign>, where it is
                  disconcerting to find <foreign xml:lang="la">constantia</foreign> itself as one of

                     rend="italic">BAlex</hi> 7.2. On the other hand, Incertus does have a reason to
                  “talk up” Mithridates’ virtues here, in that this loyal royal ally will receive a
                  kingdom as a reward from Caesar later in the work, in a passage that refers the
                  reader back to chapters 26–27: 78.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">Mithridaten Pergamenum,

                     place="foot">Furthermore, Mithridates’ claims on Caesar seem to have been a
                     matter of dispute. Incertus’ account of Mithridates’ march to Alexandria
                     differs substantially from the two accounts by Josephus (<hi rend="italic"
                        >BJ</hi> 1.187–92, <hi rend="italic">AJ</hi> 14.127–39), who provides many
                     more details and credits Antipater, not Mithridates, with the decisive actions.
                     Josephus cites Asinius Pollio and Strabo (<hi rend="italic">AJ</hi> 14.138–39)
                     and mentions none of Mithridates’ qualities. Dio’s account (42.41–43), too, has
                     different details but keeps Mithridates in the spotlight.</note> He introduces
                  the paragraphs on Mithridates’ <foreign xml:lang="la">res gestae</foreign> with a
                  catalogue of qualities (26.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">magnae nobilitatis domi
                     scientiaeque in bello et uirtutis fidei dignitatisque in amicitia
                     Caesaris</foreign>) and works his virtues into the narrative itself (26.2
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">perseuerantia constantiaque oppugnandi</foreign>, 27.5
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">prudentia</foreign> and possibly <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >constantia</foreign>). <foreign xml:lang="la">Constantiaque</foreign> in our
                  passage could certainly be a carryover from 26.2, but in favor of its authenticity
                  are both the antithesis with <foreign xml:lang="la">incaute atque
                     insolenter</foreign> and Incertus’ penchant for pairing such abstract nouns

                     clearer because it hinges on the relative expeditiousness of their respective

               <p>In chapters 34–35 Domitius orders Pharnaces to withdraw from Cappadocia and Lesser

                  Pharnaces withdraws from Cappadocia but not from Lesser Armenia. Consequently,
                  Domitius marches towards Armenia with troops, traveling W-E along a ridge between
                  Cappadocia (to the south) and Armenia (to the north). Incertus specifies two

                  <foreign xml:lang="la">poterat</foreign>): such an attack might be unlikely, but
                  would one guarantee with <foreign xml:lang="la">certas</foreign> that it was

               <p>In paragraph 36 Domitius is imagined by Pharnaces as marching from his camp to
                  Nicopolis, seven miles away, through a pass between mountains. Pharnaces set some
                  of his troops in an ambush and ordered livestock and locals to be visible within
                  the pass in order to lure Domitius into the trap. The king’s plan seems designed
                  to accommodate either a friendly or a hostile approach by Domitius, who has issued
                  an ultimatum: Pharnaces must withdraw from Lesser Armenia (34.2, 35.2). Pharnaces,
                  for his part, is still hoping for a negotiated solution, especially one that can
                  be deferred (35.1–2, 36.1, 37.1). In the text of 36.5 as transmitted<note

               <p>The sense is fine up to <foreign xml:lang="la">suspicaretur</foreign>, and even up

                  What kind of <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign> clause comes next? How are

               <p>The friend/enemy antithesis and the <foreign xml:lang="la">siue … siue</foreign>

               <p>He thereby clustered the two references to friendly behavior and the two
                  references to hostile behavior, and simplied the syntax of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >tamquam</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="la">aduentu</foreign> as a
                  circumstantial ablative. The resulting sense is good but the repair requires at
                  least three innovations, whose sequence is hard to understand. Did <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">si amicus</foreign> generate <foreign xml:lang="la">siue
                     inimicus</foreign>, which then generated <foreign xml:lang="la">siue</foreign>

                     >uero</foreign> fall out before <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign>, and
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">aduentu</foreign> acquire a final <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >s</foreign>, whereupon the orphaned <foreign xml:lang="la">in</foreign> was
                  excised as nonsensical?</p>

               <p>The difficulty of tracing a path from the original text to what is found in the

                     >siue inimicus</foreign> to later in the sentence, simultaneously changing the
                  syntax of <foreign xml:lang="la">aduentus</foreign> by dissolving its final
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">s</foreign> into the transposed phrase:</p>

               <p>With this text the puzzling <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign> introduces an
                  elliptical comparison <foreign xml:lang="la">ut in hostium fines</foreign>
                  parallel to <foreign xml:lang="la">tamquam amicorum aduentu</foreign>. The initial
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign> clause expresses Pharnaces’ double purpose:
                  that the Romans either fail to suspect the presence of the enemy (<foreign
                     xml:lang="la">ut … nihil … suspicaretur</foreign>) or scatter in pursuit of
                  booty and get killed (<foreign xml:lang="la">ut … dissiparentur dispersique
                     caederentur</foreign>). The two-part purpose is supported by parallel <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">siue</foreign> clauses, <foreign xml:lang="la">siue amicus …
                     transiret</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">siue inimicus …
                     ueniret</foreign>, a construction for which <ref target="#Nippderdey"
                     >Nipperdey</ref> cites two Ciceronian parallels (<hi rend="italic">Phil</hi>.
                  14.13, <hi rend="italic">Fin</hi>. 1.3). Clarity, it seems, has been restored, and
                  this is the text printed by <ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref>. But the explanation
                  of how clarity was lost is still complicated: <foreign xml:lang="la">siue
                     inimicus</foreign> was omitted, the omission was noticed, a repair was
                  attempted by writing the omitted words elsewhere on the page, and they were then
                  reincorporated into the text at a plausible but incorrect position following
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">siue amicus</foreign>. The alteration of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">aduentu</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la">aduentus</foreign> in
                  this scenario is poorly motivated: <foreign xml:lang="la">siue inimicus</foreign>
                  seems to have left its initial letter behind and regenerated it during the course
                  of its travels. <ref target="#Forchhammer">Forchhammer</ref> (1852, <ref

                     >92</ref>) adds that <foreign xml:lang="la">siue inimicus</foreign> contributes
                  nothing when placed in front of <foreign xml:lang="la">ut in hostium

               <p>The series of innovations is now clearer: <foreign xml:lang="la">aduentu</foreign>
                  acquired a final <foreign xml:lang="la">s</foreign>, the left-over minim was
                  omitted, and <foreign xml:lang="la">si amicus</foreign> was expanded into <foreign

                  then mean “supposing he came.” But this is still a three-part innovation involving
                  two spots in the text.</p>

               <p>In our view the apparent parallelisms in this passage have been pressed too
                     hard.<note place="foot">See, for example, the note in <ref

                  above, the text as transmitted makes sense up to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >aduentu</foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="la">s</foreign>): Pharnaces’ aim is to
                  keep Domitius in ignorance about the ambush.<note place="foot">The aim expressed
                     at 35.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">ut … nihil … suspicaretur</foreign> is consonant
                     with that expressed at 37.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">numquam … intermittebat
                        legatos de pace atque amicitia mittere ad Domitium, cum hoc ipso crederet
                        facilius eum decipi posse</foreign>, although the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >cum</foreign> clause in the latter passage could also be used to argue that
                     Pharnaces planned a preemptive attack. However, it seems more likely to reflect
                     the fact that Domitius did learn about the ambush—or so one presumes from the
                     reference to it in our text. See also
                     <!-- SJH: I changed this reference to remove the note's number. -->note <ptr
                        target="#stba-36.5-note-6"/>.</note> The text says nothing about any plan
                  for a preemptive attack on Domitius, and Pharnaces later recalls his troops to
                  prevent their being spotted (37.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">cum uereretur ne
                     cognoscerentur insidiae, suos in castra reuocauit</foreign>); their presence
                  seems to have been a precautionary measure that would allow him to respond quickly
                  if there was any overt aggression on Domitius’ part. He may not have expected
                  aggression, since he knew that Domitius’ army had been weakened by the loss of the
                  two legions that were sent to Caesar (34.3, 35.2), and he was actively seeking a
                  negotiated solution (37.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">numquam … intermittebat legatos
                     de pace atque amicitia mittere ad Domitium</foreign>; cf. 37.2 on Domitius’
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">spes pacis</foreign>), but precautions were not
                     unwarranted.<note place="foot" xml:id="stba-36.5-note-6">As it happened,
                     Domitius’ “hope of peace” kept him in camp for another day (37.2 <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">spes pacis Domitio in isdem castris morandi attulit
                        causam</foreign>), so Pharnaces lost his chance to make a preemptive attack
                     if he did plan one (37.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">amissa proximi temporis
                        occasione</foreign>).</note> On this reading the two parts of this passage
                  are not parallel (“if friend, do X, if enemy, do Y”) but rather sequential
                  (“deceive Domitius, then react to his actions”). Of the two reactions envisaged,
                  doing nothing and responding to aggression, only the second is mentioned in the
                  present passage; the first is given narrative space later (37.2, quoted above).
                  The implicit contrast here between inaction and action is expressed by the text of

               <p>When Domitius and Pharnaces finally fought, the Romans were decisively defeated.
                  Three of the four legions involved in the battle suffered catastrophic losses, and
                  Domitius retreated to Asia Minor with the veteran Thirty-sixth and a few other
                  survivors (40.4–5). The battle itself must have been chaotic, but Incertus seems
                  to have been aiming for a narrative as clear as Caesar’s usually are. The battle
                  lines are described in some detail (38.3–4, 39.2), then the events on the Roman
                  right (40.1), then those on the left (40.2), then those in the middle of the line
                  (40.2). After the Roman middle collapses, we return to the right wing (40.3) and
                  finish with the “cost-of-battle” assessment (40.4–5). The framework is clear. But
                  problems in the transmitted text prevent us from seeing exactly what happened on
                  the Roman left:</p>

                  corrupta essent, recte nemo dubitavit.” But those two words are not the only
                  problems in this passage. Here is a fuller list:</p>

                  <item n="1">The unqualified reference to an <foreign xml:lang="la">acies</foreign>

                  <item n="3">It is difficult to see which verbs go with which nominative. Word

                        >acies</foreign> the subject of the others, but since we learn later that
                     the Pontic legion was almost completely annihilated in this battle (40.4
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">Pontica legione paene tota amissa</foreign>) it seems
                     likely that <foreign xml:lang="la">legio</foreign> is the subject of <foreign

                     since Incertus has described the troop movement as “going around” (<foreign

                  <item n="5">The expression <foreign xml:lang="la">fossam circumire</foreign> is

                     hard to reconcile with the battlefield described here, where Pharnaces’ compact
                     battle line is protected on the flanks by 4-foot trenches (38.3–4) and in the
                     rear, as becomes clear from 40.1, by the walls of Nicopolis. How then could one
                     go around the trench to attack the enemy from the rear? (See further below,
                     under B).</item>

                     recruited in Pontus [34.5]), and a <foreign xml:lang="la">media acies</foreign>
                     (two legions contributed to the Roman war effort by the Galatian king Deiotarus
                     [34.4], separated by a narrow gap). Domitius also placed an unspecified number

                  here is <hi rend="italic">BAfr</hi> 59.2, where Scipio places legions <foreign

                  in this scenario <foreign xml:lang="la">paulum</foreign> is puzzling, since it
                  seems to indicate a change of course on the part of the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >legio</foreign> itself: it retreated for a little while, then did something
                  else.</p>

               <p>His <foreign xml:lang="la">secunda acies</foreign> is the same unit as the
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">legio</foreign>, but it has experienced a change of

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">legio</foreign> is the subject of all of the verbs
                  (problems 3 and 4), and it doesn’t go around the trench but crosses it (problems 4
                  and 5<note place="foot"><ref target="#Dauisius1727">Dauisius</ref> took a

                     But this makes problem 5 worse.</note>). He also makes sense of <foreign

                  word order. However, the repetition of <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign> is
                  rather awkward, and <foreign xml:lang="la">auersa</foreign> is a discordant
                  detail: one would like to know what turned the legion back around to face the
                  enemy. In any case, given the complicated series of innovations that would have
                  been required to get from this original to the transmitted text, Ciacconius is
                  appropriately doubtful about the likelihood of his solution, especially since he
                  also rewrote the first part of the sentence (<foreign xml:lang="la">cum paululum

                  although under pressure, the legion faced the enemy, as Caesar’s troops had done

                  (1)–(3). And problems (4) and (5) solve themselves if we see <foreign

                     transitu</foreign> as two stages of an single advance comparable to that
                  described more methodically in 40.1. But <foreign xml:lang="la">acie
                     secunda</foreign> creates its own problems: the unusual word order may prompt
                  the reader to see this <foreign xml:lang="la">acies</foreign> not as a military
                  formation (which would be odd with <foreign xml:lang="la">legio</foreign> as the
                  subject of <foreign xml:lang="la">conata esset</foreign>) but as the more abstract
                  “battle” (<hi rend="italic">TLL</hi> 1.409.41–81, with no examples from the
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">corpus Caesarianum</foreign>), but in a context where
                  military formations are so prevalent this seems unlikely.<note place="foot"

               <p>Excision has also been applied to the problems of this passage, without much

               <p>Chapter 46 is part of the narrative of Vatinius’ <foreign xml:lang="la">res
                     gestae</foreign> after the battle of Pharsalus (43.3–47). This narrative starts
                  and ends in Brundisium, but our passage belongs to Vatinius’ naval operations on
                  the coast of Illyricum, where he was vying with the Pompeian fleet commander M.
                  Octavius. Vatinius’ “fleet” was a motley collection of a few warships and a larger
                  number of light vessels retrofitted with rostra (44.2–4), and Octavius knew it
                  (45.1). Catching Vatinius off guard in a storm Octavius decided to attack,
                  whereupon Vatinius rapidly prepared his fleet for battle. The general urgency of
                  the task of stopping Octavius’ depredations was made clear earlier (44.1–3), but
                  Vatinius’ reasoning at this critical moment is given in the following sentence,
                  which contains a puzzling string of nouns, a murky <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >cum</foreign> clause, and an elliptical verb:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote"> Vatinius cum animaduerteret neque nauium se magnitudine
                  neque numero parem esse fortuitae dimicationi fortunae rem committere
                  maluit.</quote>

               <p>Vatinius preferred battle—to what? Evasive action, presumably, but Incertus does
                  not specify. If specification is wanted, one could emend <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >maluit</foreign>, as the scribe of T did, or fill in the blank, as <ref
                     target="#Kübler1896a">Kübler</ref> did:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote"> … dimicationi fortunae <supplied reason="lost">tamen quam
                     fugae</supplied> … maluit</quote>

               <p>But the supplement is superfluous, since <foreign xml:lang="la">quam</foreign>
                  (uel sim.) is not obligatory (cf. <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.72.3 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">quibus saluis atque incolumibus rem obtinere malebat</foreign>
                     (<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign xml:lang="la">quam interfectis</foreign>)
                  and see <hi rend="italic">TLL</hi> 8.201.78–202.8). And T’s <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >noluit</foreign> doesn’t fit the context very well, since in the following
                  sentence (quoted above) we learn that Vatinius attacked Octavius before Octavius
                  could attack him, and the connective <foreign xml:lang="la">itaque</foreign>
                  indicates that the attack was a consequence of Vatinius’ preference.<note
                     place="foot">One might also take <foreign xml:lang="la">fortuitae
                        dimicationi</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="la">parem</foreign> (cf. <hi
                        rend="italic">BG</hi> 1.40.7 <foreign xml:lang="la">pares esse nostro
                        exercitui</foreign>) and <foreign xml:lang="la">fortunae</foreign> with
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">rem committere</foreign>, but this makes Vatinius
                     irrational in what is otherwise a highly flattering narrative: “although he
                     realized that he was not equal … to a chance engagement, he preferred to
                     entrust the matter to chance.”</note>
               </p>

               <p><ref target="#Kübler1896a">Kübler</ref>’s repair also includes <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">tamen</foreign>, which clarifies the concessive nature of the
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign> clause; others had added it elsewhere. But
                  this too, although an improvement, seems unwarranted, since many of Incertus’
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign> clauses, especially in chapters 34–47, are
                  murky owing to postponed conjunctions and complicated syntax (see, e.g., 34.2,
                  35.2, 36.3, 39.1, 40.2, 42.3, 44.1, 44.3). The antithesis between calculation
                     (<foreign xml:lang="la">magnitudine</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la">numero,
                     parem</foreign>) and chance (<foreign xml:lang="la">fortuitae</foreign>,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">fortunae</foreign>) may suffice to indicate the
                  concession that Incertus intended.</p>

               <p>But the expression <foreign xml:lang="la">fortuitae dimicationi fortunae rem
                     committere</foreign> is distinctly unlovely. <foreign xml:lang="la">Rem
                     committere</foreign> could go with <foreign xml:lang="la">dimicationi</foreign>
                  (cf. <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 2.33.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">proelio rem
                     committere</foreign>; 2.38.2, 3.74.2) or <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >fortunae</foreign> (cf. Liu. 9.12.11 <foreign xml:lang="la">committere rem
                     fortunae</foreign>) but not with both, so <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >fortunae</foreign> must be genitive. But if <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >fortunae</foreign> is a subjective genitive dependent on <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">dimicationi</foreign> (for the construction see <hi rend="italic"
                     >TLL 5.1.1197.21–34), fortuitae</hi> is tautological. And if <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">fortuitae</foreign> modifies <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >fortunae</foreign>, it is otiose. In short, something has to go. Suspicion has
                  fallen on <foreign xml:lang="la">fortuitae</foreign> owing to the word’s scant
                  presence in the <foreign xml:lang="la">corpus Caesarianum</foreign> (<hi
                     rend="italic">BG</hi> 7.20.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">omnia fortuito et sine

                     xml:lang="la">fortuitu</foreign>). <foreign xml:lang="la">Fortuna</foreign>, of
                  course, is a favorite Caesarian concept (⟩70x, including recently at 43.1 and
                  43.3).</p>

               <p>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Fortuitae</foreign> was emended to an adjectival <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">futurae</foreign> already in the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >recentiores</foreign> (cf. <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.52.1 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">futuri temporis timore</foreign>). This improves the style but
                  runs counter to the sense, since Vatinius did not wait for a future engagement.
                  The scribe of T omitted <foreign xml:lang="la">fortuitae dimicationi</foreign>,
                  presumably regarding it as an alternative to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >fortunae</foreign>. Modern scholars, on the other hand, excise <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">fortunae</foreign> as a gloss on the more unusual expression
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">fortuitae dimicationi</foreign>. Their decision seems
                  right. But T may have been right in seeing the two as variants transmitted by the

               <p>This sentence describes the ships captured by Vatinius after defeating Octavius
                  near the island of Tauris (45–46; mod. Šćedro in Croatia). Three types of ship are
                  mentioned here. The term for the largest ship, as transmitted, is a bizarre
                  bilingual hybrid, <foreign xml:lang="la">penteremem</foreign>. This certainly
                  refers to what is elsewhere called a <foreign xml:lang="la">quinqueremis</foreign>

               <p>The misdeeds of Caesar’s representative in Spain, Q. Cassius, caused serious

               <p>The syntax is fine, but the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la">in ea</foreign> is
                  unclear. The demonstrative seems to point back to Corduba, but if it does, it
                  refers to debts that have not been mentioned. It is possible that they were
                  incurred during his earlier stint in Spain, but the specificity of the reference
                  to Corduba is puzzling, since this is its first occurrence in the <hi

                  Corduba, the expression ought to be <foreign xml:lang="la">in ea urbe</foreign>,
                  suggested two replacements for it, an ablative noun and a temporal adverb:</p>

               <p>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Alea</foreign> has little to recommend it apart from its
                  final two letters, since nothing in the narrative connects the cause of Cassius’
                  indebtedness with the measures he took to to remedy it; gambling would be a stray
                  detail. <foreign xml:lang="la">Antea</foreign> is a little better, since Incertus
                  did mention Cassius’ earlier office in Spain, and the temporal adverb does not
                  point specifically to Corduba. However, it adds nothing to the sense, since the
                  participle <foreign xml:lang="la">contractum</foreign> itself indicates
                  priority.</p>

               <p>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Interea</foreign> is closer to the paradosis, and Menge
                  (ibid.) explains it as a reference to the time “während er Recht spricht.” But the
                  word order associates it closely with <foreign xml:lang="la">contractum</foreign>
                  and makes it point to an unspecified period of time between Cassius’ quaestorship
                  and praetorship and events nowhere mentioned in the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >commentarii</foreign>.</p>

                  the editors who print <foreign xml:lang="la">in ea</foreign>, and explain the
                  demonstrative as proleptic. As we saw above, <ref target="#Madvig">Madvig</ref>
                  objected to the absence of a noun with <foreign xml:lang="la">ea</foreign>. But
                  there is a similar ellipsis at 47.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">in ea</foreign> (sc.
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">insula</foreign>), referring to Issa. In our view,

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">prouincia</foreign>. That is, the demonstrative
                  anticipates a substantive that comes later in the sentence: <foreign xml:lang="la"

               <p>Chapter 49 concerns the finances of Caesar’s governor in Further Spain, Q. Cassius
                  Longinus, particularly his extortion of money from the Spaniards. The first
                  sentence supplies necessary context: one of Cassius’ goals was to reduce his
                  personal debt (49.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">contractum in ea</foreign> [<hi

                  four sentences to the governor’s procedures, but problems in the transmitted text
                  of the first part of the second sentence obscure the details (the rest of the
                  passage is quoted above for context):</p>

               <p>The main problems are (1) uncertainty about the reading of the archetype at

                  which creates uncertainty about the subject of the sentence: is it <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">causae</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">tenues</foreign>? (2)
                  The awkwardness of adjacent genitives dependent on different substantives

                  meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la">simultatium</foreign>: what kinds of disputes
                  does Incertus have in mind?<note place="foot">The peculiar expression <foreign

                     via requisition and lawsuit, not as a collective. But <foreign xml:lang="la"
                        >grex</foreign> seems compatible with the hyperbole of the passage (<foreign
                        xml:lang="la">neque ullum genus … nemo erat … quin</foreign>). See below for
                     an emendation to <foreign xml:lang="la">coniciebantur</foreign>.</note>
               </p>

               <p>All of these problems are rendered more intractable by uncertainty about the
                  bookkeeping procedure specified in <foreign xml:lang="la">sibi expensas
                     ferri</foreign> in the previous sentence. Similar accounting language recurs in
                  the following paragraph in connection with members of Cassius’ inner circle, his
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">familiares</foreign>, who “were in the habit of
                  crediting to themselves whatever they had seized and assigning to Cassius whatever
                  sums were due for payment or subject to claims (50.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">sibi …

                     interciderat aut erat interpellatum Cassio assignabant</foreign>), but in 50.2
                  the technical terms seem less technical than those in the present passage,
                  referring to who got what, not which category (income or expenditure?) a sum was
                  assigned to.<note place="foot">However, <ref target="#Schneider">Schneider</ref>
                     (1888, ad loc.) views the accounting language in 49.2, too, as used loosely,
                     such that <foreign xml:lang="la">expensum ferre</foreign> simply means
                     “pay.”</note> However, the later passage, along with <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >domus</foreign> in 49.2, does suggest that these same <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >familiares</foreign> are envisaged as acting on Cassius’ orders in our passage
                     (<foreign xml:lang="la">cogebat</foreign>) and entering sums received as sums
                  paid, i.e., putting those from whom Cassius had extorted money into his debt for
                  the amount they had just paid him, potentially doubling their loss should he try
                  to collect on those “debts,” and in any case making it impossible for them to
                  demand restitution in the future. As <ref target="#Vielhaber1869">Vielhaber</ref>
                  (1869, <ref
                     target="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044098632391?urlappend=%3Bseq=645"
                     >567–568</ref>, n. 47) explains, this would be a precautionary measure adopted
                  in view of future lawsuits, where account books could be entered as evidence.
                  However, it is unclear whose account books are at issue here: his or theirs? In
                  the scenario described here it is assumed that the books are those of Cassius,
                  since after the assassination attempt he convoked those who had paid him money and
                  seems to have ordered them to alter the entries in their account books as well:
                  56.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">sanatis uulneribus arcessit omnes qui sibi pecunias
                     expensas tulerant acceptasque eas iubet referri</foreign>. But in this scenario
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">patiebatur</foreign> is surprising,<note place="foot"
                     >As is noted by <ref target="#Vielhaber1869">Vielhaber</ref> (1869, 567–568, n.
                     47). He suggests that the account books in both 49.2 and 56.3 are those of the
                     provincials, and that Cassius wants to ensure that any expenditures recorded
                     there correspond to subsequent income, indicating that their “loans” had been
                     repaid.</note> unless we are to assume that his profit-hungry <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">familiares</foreign> were pressing this procedure on Cassius.
                  Further confusion arises from Incertus’ report that Cassius had operated similarly
                  as quaestor (50.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">cum Longinus imperator eadem faceret quae
                     fecerat quaestor</foreign>), since his earlier tenure resulted in debt and his
                  goal in 48/47 is to clear that debt. But perhaps the point of the present passage
                  is that he changed his bookkeeping procedures so that instead of incurring debt he
                  emerged as his victims’ creditor.</p>

               <p>Some basic orientation can be derived from the insistent binaries in the passage
                  quoted above: requisition vs. prosecution, large and visible profit vs. small and
                  sordid profit, <foreign xml:lang="la">domus</foreign> vs. <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >tribunal</foreign>, financial risks (<foreign xml:lang="la">uadimonio …
                     iacturas … detrimenta rei familiaris</foreign>) vs. criminal charges (<foreign
                     xml:lang="la">in reos … periculorum</foreign>). Incertus’ Cassius seems to have
                  applied pressure both directly and indirectly in pursuit of money to pay his
                  debts.</p>

               <p>The first of the problems listed above is the most consequential. Should we read
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">causae</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la"

                     >causae</foreign> have equal authority, and either might have turned into the
                  other owing to pressure from the adjacent words, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >simultatium</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">tenues</foreign>.<note

                  than purposive (“for the sake of”) meaning<foreign xml:lang="la">,</foreign> is

                  locupletium divitias peti appareret.” But Incertus’ Cassius is unconcerned about
                  his public image—for another of his flagrant abuses see
                  <!-- SJH: I changed the reference to remove the note's number. -->note <ptr

                  provincials that he is the target of two unsuccessful assassination attempts and a
                  successful defection.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, the context makes it problematic to take <foreign xml:lang="la"

                     >coniciebantur</foreign>, since it is clear that Cassius favored wealthy

               <p>In chapter 60 the rebellion against Cassius has reached a point where armed
                  conflict seems inevitable. Of the five legions originally controlled by Cassius
                  two and a half have mutinied (57.1–5) and put themselves under the leadership of
                  the quaestor M. Marcellus (59.1). Marcellus’ forces are based in Corduba itself,
                  Cassius’ are on high ground across the Baetis River, about four miles distant
                  (59.1). Cassius has taken the initiative by ravaging Cordoban fields and buildings
                  outside the city (59.2), and Marcellus’ troops demand action (60.1). In the
                  present sentence Marcellus does act, but with considerable reluctance, the grounds
                  for which are only partly clear in the text as transmitted, which is printed by
                     <ref target="#Nipperdey">Nipperdey</ref> and other editors (here with
                  Nipperdey’s punctuation):</p>

                     >confligere</foreign> from the indirect statement dependent on <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">putaret</foreign> to serve as the subject of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">esset</foreign>. The syntax is perhaps tolerable, although the
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">variatio</foreign> in the modifiers of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">confligere</foreign> is more suited to the style of Tacitus than
                  to that of Incertus. However, the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la">suae
                     potestatis esset</foreign> is unclear: does it allude to Marcellus’ probable
                  inability to control his troops? This would align with the order Cassius gave him
                  earlier, to retain control of Corduba (57.4 <foreign xml:lang="la">ut
                     eam</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Cordubam</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="la">in potestate retineret</foreign>)
                  and his own subsequent prediction about the difficulty of controlling the troops
                  (61.4 <foreign xml:lang="la">necessitate est adductus, ut neque confligeret—cuius
                     si rei facultas esset resistere incitatis militibus non poterat—neque uagari
                     Cassium latius pateretur</foreign>). But the former passage refers to a
                  civilian population and in the latter passage Incertus specifies that it is
                  resistance to the soldiers’ impetuosity that would be impossible, not fighting per
                  se. Plus, it seems odd for him to assert that fighting is not in Marcellus’ power
                  when the quaestor is about to take his troops across the river and array them for
                  battle (<foreign xml:lang="la">legiones Baetim traducit aciemque
                     instruit</foreign>). <foreign xml:lang="la">Potestas</foreign> may, however,
                  allude to the fact that Marcellus does not have <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >imperium</foreign>; the mutinous legions call him “praetor” (59.1), as they
                  had done to earlier leaders (53.4, cf. 57.3), but his magistracy is in fact a
                  quaestorship (57.4). <foreign xml:lang="la">Potestas</foreign> does occasionally
                  denote “official capacity” in the <foreign xml:lang="la">corpus
                     Caesarianum</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">BAfr</hi> 4.1 <foreign xml:lang="la"

                     potestate</foreign>; 56.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">regis … potestatem</foreign>;
                  77.1 <foreign xml:lang="la">sub dicione et potestate</foreign>; for the possessive
                  adjective one may compare <hi rend="italic">BG</hi> 4.16.5 <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >cur sui quicquam esse imperii aut</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>.

                     Rhenum postularet</foreign>). But in all of these passages the meaning of
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">potestas</foreign> is clarified by the presence of other
                  “constitutional” terms. In our passage <foreign xml:lang="la">potestas</foreign>
                  alone would have to denote Marcellus’ authority.</p>

               <p>Repairs have been sought, with suspicion focusing on the second occurrence of
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">esset</foreign>. The context establishes two parameters
                  for emendation: (1) the <foreign xml:lang="la">quod</foreign> clause must explain
                  the unusually emotional expression <foreign xml:lang="la">confligere
                     miserrimum</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >esse</foreign>), and (2) the <foreign xml:lang="la">quod</foreign> clause must
                  end before <foreign xml:lang="la">legiones</foreign>, which belongs to the main
                     clause.<note place="foot">This superlative occurs only twice elsewhere in the

               <p>A relatively simple emendation was already available in the <foreign xml:lang="la"

               <p>This emendation simplies the syntax of <foreign xml:lang="la">confligere</foreign>
                  by putting it in a single accusative/infinitive clause with both of its

                     >suae potestatis</foreign>. But it does not really solve any of the other
                  problems mentioned above, and the present infinitive seems distinctly odd with the
                  second predicate, which is in effect a prediction about a specific future (note
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">si … facultas esset</foreign> in 61.4) rather than a

                  explanation adds very little, especially by comparison with the first <foreign

                     xml:lang="la">miserrimum</foreign>.</p>

               <p>Another possibility would be to find a supplement that would place <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">esset</foreign> in the extant <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >quod</foreign> clause, along the lines of Ciacconius’ emendation, discussed
                  above. As an <foreign xml:lang="la">exempli gratia</foreign> supplement based on
                  the subsequent course of events we considered:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">Marcellus cum confligere miserrimum putaret, quod et
                  uictoris et uicti detrimentum ad eundem Caesarem esset redundaturum neque suae

                        rend="underline">receptus</hi></supplied>, legiones Baetim traducit.</quote>

               <p>With this supplement Marcellus would consider combat utterly wretched “because the
                  loss for both the victor and defeated would similarly redound on Caesar and
                  retreat was not in his power.” The phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">esset
                     receptus</foreign> could be misconstrued as a pluperfect verb form, of course,
                  but the same is true at <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.45.6 <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Hac nostris erat receptus</foreign> and <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 3.45.5
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">erat per decliue receptus</foreign>. However, the
                  difficulties of the terrain are not mentioned until later in the narrative
                  (60.4–5, esp. <foreign xml:lang="la">cum … quid transitus fluminis uitii
                     difficultatisque haberet cognitum esset</foreign>), and the two explanations
                  for <foreign xml:lang="la">miserrimum</foreign> are both strangely dissimilar and
                  strangely arranged, with the proximate and practical worry about retreat placed
                  after the future and general worry about what the battle would cost Caesar. And
                  even if one solves the latter problem by placing a comma before <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">neque</foreign> and making <foreign xml:lang="la">esset</foreign>
                  <supplied reason="lost"><foreign xml:lang="la">receptus</foreign></supplied>
                  parallel to <foreign xml:lang="la">putaret</foreign>, the fact that we don’t know
                  about the difficulties of the terrain gives pause.</p>

               <p>In the end we decided that no supplement (and hence no lacuna) is needed here, and
                  that the transmitted text, despite the awkward syntax of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >confligere</foreign> and the ambiguity of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >potestatis</foreign>, was acceptable. Marcellus’ worry about the limits of his
                  authority aligns well his subsequent decision to withdraw his troops at the first
                  opportunity (60.3) and with Caesar’s obiter dictum at <hi rend="italic">BC</hi>
                  3.51.4: <foreign xml:lang="la">aliae … sunt legati partes atque
                     imperatoris</foreign>. Marcellus’ loyalty to Caesar is stressed at 59.1, his
                  deference to authority at 63.2 (<foreign xml:lang="la">huic</foreign> [<hi
                     rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign xml:lang="la">Lepido</foreign>] <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">uenienti sine dubitatione Marcellus se credit</foreign>), and his
                  reluctance to fight is mentioned more forcefully than in the present passage at
                  61.4 (quoted above). The repairs reported in the apparatus indicate our lingering
                  dissatisfaction with the paradosis and suggest possible approaches for improving
                  it.</p>

               <p>After a tense period in which the two Caesarian armies in Further Spain, one loyal
                  to Caesar’s original legate, Q. Cassius Longinus, the other to Caesar himself but
                  not to Cassius, seem likely to fight one another, a truce is finally arranged at
                  Ulia and the leaders negotiate a resolution that involves releasing Cassius from
                  his present encirclement by demolishing some fortifications (63.1–4). The present
                  sentence concerns a surprise attack during the truce by troops commanded by
                  Cassius’ ally Bogus, king of Mauretania (cf. 59.2, 62.1–2). The transmitted text
                  has an obvious problem: the subjunctives are inexplicable.<note place="foot">The
                     faulty syntax is signaled in U by a “query” symbol in the left margin and a

                     similar system of notation appears on the same page in connection with 64.2

               <p>The postponement of <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign> is a feature of Incertus’

                     >200</ref>) addressed the new problem by adding <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >pace</foreign> to create a second ablative absolute with <foreign

               <p>The <foreign xml:lang="la">opera</foreign> are now unmodified, but their identity
                  is clear from the preceding narrative (61.5 <foreign xml:lang="la">operibus in

                     ab operibus</foreign>); Cassius had demanded their dismantlement (63.4 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">postulat uti munitiones disicerentur</foreign>). Parallelism has
                  been restored, but it is hard to explain a two-part innovation here: either there
                  were two unrelated omissions or a scribe tried to repair a text that was
                  nonsensical after <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign> was omitted before <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">con</foreign>-. But in the latter case the excision of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">pace</foreign> is not the most obvious move.</p>

               <p><ref target="#Castiglioni">Castiglioni</ref> (1924, 239) suggested that <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">cum</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">pace</foreign> were
                  adjacent when omitted:</p>

               <p>This simplifies the innovation but weakens the paleographical justification for
                  the omission of <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign>. This repair was adopted by
                     <ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref> (1927). But the expression <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">constituta pace</foreign> is problematic, since <foreign

                  corpus, despite the fact that Caesar refers to many peace negotiations; Caesarian
                  expressions include <foreign xml:lang="la">pace facta</foreign> (<hi rend="italic"
                     >BG</hi> 2.29.5, 3.1.4), <foreign xml:lang="la">pace confirmata</foreign> (<hi

                  <foreign xml:lang="la">pacem tota prouincia constitutam</foreign>. So we

               <p>The problems in this passage about Caesar’s journey from Cilicia to Pontus through
                  Cappadocia are both historical and textual. Both center on the word <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign>.</p>

               <p>The main historical problem is the identity of Comana. There are two cities called
                  Comana in Cappadocia and Cappadocian Pontus, but it is hard to say which is meant
                  here, since the information supplied by the reference to the famous temple of
                  Bellona, which points to the Cappadocian city, conflicts with the route deduced
                  from the prior reference to Mazaca, the capital of Cappadocia: a journey to Comana
                  after two days at Mazaca would have taken Caesar away from Pontus and the coming
                  fight with Pharnaces, towards which, as the passages stresses, he was hastening
                  eagerly (66.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">cupiditate proficiscendi ad bellum gerendum
                     non diutius moratur</foreign>; 66.5 <foreign xml:lang="la">simili
                     uelocitate</foreign>). A secondary problem is the apparently unmotivated
                  two-day stop in Mazaca, which is hard to ignore given the incompatibility of
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">non diutius moratur</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >commoratus</foreign>. </p>

               <p>The main textual problem is the absence of a main verb for the second part of the
                  opening compound sentence (<foreign xml:lang="la">magnisque … habeatur</foreign>).
                  This obscures the syntax of <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana uetustissimum et
                     sanctissimum in Cappadocia Bellonae templum</foreign>. Are <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">templum</foreign>
                  nominative? accusative? in apposition? The secondary textual problems indicated in
                  the apparatus involve the asyndetic list of ablatives of respect (66.3 <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">maiestate imperio potentia</foreign>) and the position of the
                  ablative absolute (66.4 <foreign xml:lang="la">iure minime dubio, uetustate tamen
                     intermisso</foreign>); neither needs discussion here.</p>

               <p>An early repair to the main textual problem, the addition of <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">uenit</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign>,
                  completed the syntax and made <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign> and <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">templum</foreign> accusative. But it left the two in
                  uncomfortable apposition. <ref target="#Nipperdey">Nipperdey</ref>’s placement of
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">uenit</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Comana</foreign> instead of before allows one to explain the verb’s omission
                  as a jump from <foreign xml:lang="la">uen</foreign>- to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >uet</foreign>-. But the apposition is still a problem, and both repairs
                  exacerbate the historical problems by apparently having Caesar detour to
                  Cappadocian Comana after an unproductive stay in Mazaca. <ref target="#Madvig"
                     >Madvig</ref><!-- SJH: Removed reference since it is repeated below -->
                  declared the supplement misguided and the text sound, taking <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">templum</foreign>
                  (still in apposition) as objects of <foreign xml:lang="la">adiudicauit</foreign>
                  and explaining the closer object <foreign xml:lang="la">id</foreign> as a
                  resumptive pronoun necessitated by the distance between Comana and its verb (31
                  words). His analysis of the syntax is not entirely persuasive—why <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">id</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="la">ea,</foreign> which
                  would remove the apposition by making <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign> and
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">templum</foreign> parallel objects in asyndeton?—but on
                  his reading the problem of Caesar’s route through Cappadocia disappears (1873,
                     <ref
                     target="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924021596675?urlappend=%3Bseq=297"
                     >285</ref>): “Mazacae, non Comanis, de templo statuit.” Caesar made his
                  decision about Comana and the temple without going there. The solution is
                  particularly appealing because the following sentence, although somewhat opaque
                  owing to its lacuna, clearly concerns decisions pertaining to Cappadocian royalty,
                  whose seat was in Mazaca. Madvig’s explanation also supplies welcome information
                  about why a hurrying Caesar spent two days in Mazaca: two days for two decisions
                  about the future administration of a powerful priesthood and a kingdom. But syntax
                  of the transmitted text remains unsatisfactory, and subsequent editors, including
                     <ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref> and <ref target="#Andrieu">Andrieu</ref>, have
                  posited, with <ref target="#Kübler1896a">Kübler</ref>, a multi-word lacuna between
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >uetustissimum</foreign>.</p>

               <p>The possibility that our Comana is in Cappadocian Pontus rather than Cappadocia
                  proper is suggested by Strabo, a native of Pontus adolescent in 47 BCE, who in
                  discussing Comana Pontica in his <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> says that it had
                  a temple modeled on the one in Cappadocia and once had a priest named Lycomedes,
                  and echoes the description of the priesthood’s importance, which had earlier been
                  held by Strabo’s own great-great-grandfather (12.3.32–36). Strabo tells us that
                  the tenure of the priesthood in Comana Pontica had been a bone of contention from
                  Sulla onwards, with the latest recipient being Pompey’s beneficiary, so a
                  Caesarian intervention makes sense. But it is difficult to see the Pontic city in
                  a text in which <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana uenit</foreign> is sandwiched
                  between references to the capital and king of Cappadocia. This has led to the
                  assumption that Incertus is unaware of the distinction between the two
                     cities.<note place="foot">Bibliography and discussion in <ref
                        target="#Gaertner-Hausburg">Gaertner-Hausburg</ref> (2013, 91 n. 65).</note>
                  But that assumption is predicated on the emendation <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >uenit</foreign>. So we need to take another look at the lacuna.</p>

               <p>Desiderata include (1) a verb, (2) a syntactic differentiation between <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">templum</foreign>
                  that accommodates the demonstrative <foreign xml:lang="la">id</foreign>, and (3)
                  content that keeps Caesar out of Cappadocian Comana, that allows for a reference
                  to Comana Pontica, and that explains Caesar’s stop at Mazaca. Here are two
                  possibilities for the missing syntax; the words in each lacuna are supplied
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">exempli gratia</foreign>:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">“stopping at Mazaca for two days since Comana was exhausted
                  by disputes and there was a claimant for the shrine of Bellona, the oldest and

               <p>Both of them make <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign> the object of a verb in
                  a subordinate clause whose conjunction is postponed and, after repunctuation, use
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">adiudicauit</foreign> as the desired main verb. Incertus
                  postpones <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign> twice (45.3, 56.6) and <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">cum</foreign> frequently (<ref target="#Gaertner-Hausburg"
                     >Gaertner-Hausburg</ref> [2013] 36–39), so the stylistic oddity passes
                  muster.</p>

               <p>In the first version the lacuna contains a verb, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >confirmarentur</foreign>, that can govern both <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Comana</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">templum</foreign>, which are
                  connected by <foreign xml:lang="la">et</foreign>. There is a parallel for the
                  double object at <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.29.3 (<foreign xml:lang="la">interim
                     ueterem exercitum duas Hispanias confirmari … nolebat [sc. Caesar]</foreign>),
                  and Incertus had earlier used <foreign xml:lang="la">confirmare</foreign> in a
                  passage where Caesar was intent upon settling protracted disputes involving
                  Eastern royalty (33.2 <foreign xml:lang="la">priusquam diuturnitate confirmarentur
                     regum imperia</foreign>). The omission would have originated in a skip from
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="la">uet</foreign>-.
                  With this supplement Caesar’s stop in Mazaca is explained by the purpose clause
                  but it is still hard to see Comana as anything but the Cappadocian city, given the
                  presence of <foreign xml:lang="la">in Cappadociae … templum</foreign> and, later,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">regio Cappadocum genere ortus</foreign>. And the
                  supplement sits somewhat awkwardly with <foreign xml:lang="la">id</foreign>, since
                  the demonstrative points to a resolution of the temple issue but leaves the
                  problem of Comana apparently unresolved.</p>

               <p>In the second version the supplement contains two verbs and a connective between
                  them. <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >templum</foreign> are now subjects of their respective verbs, and Caesar’s
                  stop in Mazaca is explained by the <foreign xml:lang="la">cum</foreign>-clause.
                  His intention of settling <foreign xml:lang="la">dissensiones</foreign> in the
                  East was announced in the previous paragraph (65.1 <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >praeferendum existimauit quas in prouincias regionesque uenisset eas ita
                     relinquere constitutas ut domesticis dissensionibus liberarentur</foreign>),
                  and the description of a territory troubled by <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >dissensiones</foreign> is paralleled at 42.2 (<foreign xml:lang="la">prouincia
                     … finitimo bello ac dissensionibus confecta et uastata</foreign>); the verb in
                  this parallel may not be precisely the right one for our passage. The reference to
                  the claimant comes from just below (66. 4 <foreign xml:lang="la">sacerdotium id
                     repetebat</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sc</hi>. <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >Lycomedes</foreign>]), where, however, the object is the priesthood rather
                  than the shrine itself. The omission of this string of words is harder to explain
                  than the omission of the <foreign xml:lang="la">ut</foreign>-clause, but the gap
                  created by the reference to a solution for the temple but nothing about the
                  trouble in Comana is less apparent, since the trouble in Comana might have been
                  centered on control of the temple.<note place="foot">From Strabo it appears that
                     Caesar’s arrangement involved both the priesthood mentioned here and a gift of
                     land (12.3.35).</note> With this supplement Comana again seems to be the city
                  in Cappadocia.</p>

               <p>Both supplements deliver some but not all of the desiderata listed above. Neither
                  acquits Incertus of confusing the two Comanas—assuming that Strabo deserves our
                  credence—but both provide a main verb, keep Caesar out of the Cappadocian city,
                  and explain Caesar’s stop. The syntax of each repair makes a welcome distinction
                  between the city and the shrine, but in neither version is <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >id</foreign> entirely unproblematic. So neither is good enough to go in the
                  text, and we follow <ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref> and <ref target="#Andrieu"

               <p>This extract is part of Deiotarus’ speech as a suppliant before Caesar. His
                  defense has two parts. Here, he explains that his military support of Pompey was a
                  consequence of the absence of Caesarian troops in his region. In the following
                  sentence he adds that he did not think he should be a judge of Roman conflicts.
                  Caesar’s response is given in 68.1; he objects mainly to the latter sentence.</p>

               <p>The main puzzle in this passage is the syntax of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >exercitibus imperiisque</foreign>. In the paradosis neither word is obviously
                  connected to any expression in the vicinity, and the plural forms make a peculiar
                  pair:</p>

                     imperiis</foreign>, transposing the connective and converting <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">exercitibus</foreign> into a causal participle parallel to

               <p>The instrumental ablative is a neat and attractive solution to the syntax problem,
                  and one can hypothesize a two-step innovation: first the substitution of the

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">excitus</foreign>, and second the transposition of the
                  connective to connect the two nouns. But <foreign xml:lang="la">excitus</foreign>
                  is indeed rare. In fact the only extant example occurs at <foreign xml:lang="la"

                  himself with a similar range of options.</p>

               <p>In 1887 <ref target="#Dinter">Dinter</ref> took a new approach to the puzzle,
                  adding <foreign xml:lang="la">coercitus</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >exercitibus imperiisque</foreign> and leaving the noun phrase as in the
                  paradosis:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia
                  Caesaris habuisset, <hi rend="underline">coercitus exercitibus imperiisque</hi> in
                  Cn. Pompei castris fuisset</quote>

               <quote rend="blockquote">… the fact that, located in a part of the world that had no
                  Caesarian garrisons, constrained by armies and orders he had been in the camp of
                  Gnaeus Pompey</quote>

               <p>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Coerceo</foreign> is not as rare as <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >excio</foreign>, although the perfect passive participle occurs nowhere in the
                  Caesarian corpus. The verb itself is used once elsewhere in the <hi rend="italic"
                     >Bellum Alexandrinum</hi>, of rulers who might prove ungrateful to Rome: 33.4
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">si essent ingrati, posse isdem praesidiis
                     coerceri</foreign>. Similarly, there is an ablative of means with the
                  infinitive at <hi rend="italic">BC</hi> 1.67.4: <foreign xml:lang="la">at luce
                     multum per se pudorem omnium oculis, multum etiam tribunorum militum et

                     contineri soleant</foreign>. On the whole, this suggestion is helpful in
                  preserving the transmitted nouns and in proposing a more common verb, although the
                  absence of any participial forms of this verb is troubling.</p>

               <p>In 1889 <ref target="#Cornelissen">Cornelissen</ref> tried a drastically different
                  approach, inserting <foreign xml:lang="la">in</foreign> before <foreign

               <quote rend="blockquote">… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia

               <p>The <foreign xml:lang="la">praesidia</foreign> are now metaphorical and the armies
                  and orders are Caesar’s, not Pompey’s. There are some parallels for <foreign

                  ablative dependent on <foreign xml:lang="la">in</foreign>. It is possible to
                  explain how <foreign xml:lang="la">in</foreign> fell out in our passage, given the

                  suggestion is that all other examples of <foreign xml:lang="la">in Caesaris
                     praesidiis</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">in Caesaris castris</foreign>
                  have a spatial sense that is lacking here, since these armies do not actually

               <p>
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">Cogere</foreign> is a fairly common word in the Caesarian
                  corpus, and this use of the participle with an ablative of means is paralleled in

               <p>The non-existent armies are now Caesar’s and the commands come from Caesar’s
                  enemies. <ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref> is the first to take -<foreign
                     xml:lang="la">que</foreign> as breaking up two phrases rather than joining two
                  nouns. In doing so, Klotz diagnoses a problem, namely, that the combination of
                  plural forms of <foreign xml:lang="la">exercitus</foreign> and <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> is problematic, since it does not occur
                  elsewhere in the Caesarian corpus and is rare elsewhere, even though the two words
                  are individually very common.<note place="foot">Where the plurals do appear in
                     tandem <foreign xml:lang="la">imperia</foreign> generally has a broader sense
                     than is appropriate here: e.g., Cic. <foreign xml:lang="la">Clu</foreign>. 154
                        <foreign xml:lang="la">insignia, fasces, exercitus, imperia,
                        prouinciae</foreign>.</note> But Klotz’ proposal requires emendation in two
                  spots in the same phrase. The hypothesis of independent omissions is not very
                  likely.</p>

               <p>Since none of the solutions discussed has been entirely satisfactory, we have
                  adopted a different repair. We follow most editors in inserting a participle to
                  govern the instrumental ablatives; <ref target="#Hoffmann1890">Hoffmann</ref>’s
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">coactus</foreign> seems the most persuasive suggestion,
                  since it is the most common in Caesarian usage. But we place the participle before
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">exercitibus imperiisque</foreign> and insert a
                  connective to facilitate the coordination of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >positus</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">coactus</foreign>:</p>

               <quote rend="blockquote">… quod, in ea parte positus terrarum quae nulla praesidia
                  Caesaris habuisset <supplied reason="lost"><hi rend="underline">et
                     coactus</hi></supplied><hi rend="underline"> exercitibus imperiisque</hi>, in
                  Cn. Pompei castris fuisset</quote>

               <quote rend="blockquote">… the fact that, as he was located in a part of the world

               <p>The omission of <foreign xml:lang="la">et</foreign> and the following word might
                  have been prompted by the ending of <foreign xml:lang="la">habuisset</foreign>. We
                  have left <foreign xml:lang="la">exercitibus imperiisque</foreign> intact, since
                  the <foreign xml:lang="la">exercitibus</foreign> of unspecified supporters of
                  Pompey corresponds to the <foreign xml:lang="la">praesidia</foreign> that Caesar
                  has not provided. Admittedly, the unusual combination is problematic. Furthermore,
                  if Deiotarus is claiming that he was forced to join Pompey by Pompeian armies, one
                  might expect Caesar to point out that the king did not actually engage in combat
                  with these armies. Instead, in his reply, Caesar focuses exclusively on Deiotarus’
                  subsequent claim that he did not know whose <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >imperia</foreign> to obey. To keep the focus on <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >imperiis</foreign>, we have suggested <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >potestatibus</foreign> as a possible alternative to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >exercitibus</foreign>, a term that is found in combination with <foreign

               <p><ref target="#Klotz">Klotz</ref> suggests in his apparatus that the transmitted

                     <foreign xml:lang="la">Rufum necessitatis excusatio defendet</foreign>. The
                  wording is different, but the concept is perhaps sufficiently similar to defend
                  the paradosis, particularly given the problems inherent in the repairs currently

               <p>This description of the famous site of two consequential battles—according to
                  Pliny, Zela was <foreign xml:lang="la">nobilis clade Triarii et uictoriae C.
                     Caesaris</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">Nat</hi>. 6.10)—is barely legible.
                  Editors have been variously tolerant of its difficulties since none of the words
                  is obviously corrupt and the general picture is clear: Pharnaces established his
                  camp on the prominent hill near Zela on which his formidable father, Mithridates,
                  had established his own camp twenty years earlier and from which Mithridates had
                  inflicted a devastating defeat on Roman troops led by C. Valerius Triarius.<note

                     But the unusual expression (see below) is unlikely to have originated as a

                     connection to Zela relevant to the tactics of the coming battle, or to the
                     memory of both battles? As it happens, the town per se plays no role in either
                     battle: it is nothing more than a place name for battles fought in the
                     vicinity. Accounts of the battle of 67 BCE situate it on level ground (see

                        itineribus</foreign> it seems to be a rather loose ablative either of route
                     (cf. 35.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">locisque superioribus iter facere
                        instituit</foreign>) or means (cf. 30.3 <foreign xml:lang="la">castellum …
                        brachiis … cum opere castrorum coniunxerat</foreign>). Furthermore the

                        >editissimus</foreign>—which places are higher than the highest hill?—and
                     the expression <foreign xml:lang="la">superioribus … itineribus</foreign> is

                     comparable role. It is hard to say whether its omission by S is deliberate.
                     Another possibility is that <foreign xml:lang="la">unus</foreign> originated in
                     a misconstrued abbreviation, here possibly for <foreign xml:lang="la"

               <p>Problem 1 is the easiest to solve: as Clarke said in 1712 (543), one can either

                     >unus</foreign> or assume an anacoluthon. In the latter scenario the thought
                  initiated by <foreign xml:lang="la">editissimus unus</foreign> is eventually
                  expressed by <foreign xml:lang="la">hunc locum Pharnaces … occupauit</foreign>.

                  Incertus to explain why the two battles were remembered as having been fought at
                  Zela, when they weren’t. The distance is also minimized later in the sentence with

                  have punctuated the afterthought as a parenthesis except that the profusion of
                  dashes would have been confusing.) Incertus may have been motivated by the

               <p>In the first two spots the problems are clear and permit convincing
                     resolutions.<note place="foot">We also note the excision of <foreign
                        xml:lang="la">hostis</foreign> proposed by <ref target="#Bentley">Thomas
                        Bentley</ref> (1742, ad loc.); the term is certainly peculiar in this
                     context, where a more neutral word such as <foreign xml:lang="la">dux</foreign>
                     would be more plausible, if any word at all is needed.</note> The archetype’s
                  reading at the third spot, however, is a puzzle in itself. Since Pharnaces is at
                  this moment moving up a hillside intending to fight a battle, the combination of
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">in proelium</foreign> and the pluperfect <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">descenderat</foreign> makes little sense. However, the presence
                  of the unwanted expression <foreign xml:lang="la">in proelium</foreign> in both
                  branches of the stemma (ST and U) indicates that this reading was in the archetype
                  and in its descendants ν and μ. In the ν branch V will have substituted the
                  synonymous <foreign xml:lang="la">in bellum</foreign> (for innovations in V see
                     <ref target="#Damon2015a">Damon 2015a</ref>, lviii-lix). The reading of μ is
                  harder to discern: it must have had <foreign xml:lang="la">in proelium</foreign>,
                  since U has this phrase, but it must also have had <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >praeruptam</foreign>, which is in both U and M. It is possible but not
                  demonstrable that these variants reached μ from the archetype (for archetypal
                  variants see <ref target="#Damon2015a">Damon 2015a</ref>, xxiv-xxv). If so,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">praeruptam</foreign> was not transmitted to ν’s
                  descendants, perhaps because the hyperbaton <foreign xml:lang="la">in praeruptam …
                     uallem</foreign> seemed more immediately problematic than <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">in proelium</foreign>.<note place="foot">On hyperbata in the
                        <title>Bellum Alexandrinum</title> see Gaertner and Hausburg 2013, 36–39.
                     Incertus is particularly fond of clause-ending hyperbata of the form
                     adjective-verb-substantive (see the discussion of 35.3 above, n. 11).</note> Be
                  that as it may, what one wants to know is whether <foreign xml:lang="la"
                     >praeruptam</foreign> reached μ by transmission, in other words, whether it may
                  be an authentic reading.</p>

               <p>The fact that the valley into which Pharnaces had descended was described as
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">praerupta</foreign> in the preceding sentence (74.3
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">At Pharnaces … descendere praerupta ualle
                     coepit</foreign>) suggests that the adjective may have been supplied here as a
                  convenient repair for the semantic problem discussed above. On the other hand,
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">eodem gradu</foreign> suggests that Incertus wanted the
                  two phrases read together here, and in any case he is not particularly scrupulous
                  about avoiding repetition (see <ref target="#Gaertner-Hausburg">Gaertner and
                     Hausburg</ref> 2013, 37 n. 38). But if <foreign xml:lang="la">in
                     praeruptam</foreign> was the original reading, it is hard to see how <foreign
                     xml:lang="la">in proelium</foreign> arose. It cannot have been an unconscious
                  remembrance of a phrase used elsewhere in the <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi>, since
                     <foreign xml:lang="la">in proelium descendere</foreign> occurs only at Fron.

               <p>The noun will have arisen as a misreading of <foreign xml:lang="la"
