1.1 Sing, goddess, the godlike wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus,
1.2 that sociopathic wrath that caused countless pains for the Achaeans.
1.3  It hurled to Hades many precious lives
1.4 of warriors. And it began to make their bodies into picked-over scraps for dogs
1.5 and for birds, all of them; and the plan of Zeus began to be fulfilled,
1.6 from the point where  first, the two having both begun a competition with each other, both of them faced off,
1.7 the son of Atreus, lord of men, and god-like Achilles.
1.8 Who  then of the gods threw together the two of them to fight in competition with one another?
1.9 The son of Leto and of Zeus: for that one, filled with anger at the king,
1.10 set in motion an evil sickness up through the camp. And the soldiers began to be killed,
1.11 because he showed disrespect to that man Chryses, the god-talker.
1.12 What man? -- the son of Atreus. This is why: that man, came to the swift ships of the Achaeans
1.13 in order to free  his daughter and bearing boundless ransom,
1.14 holding the wreaths of the far-shooter Apollo in his hands
1.15 high up on his golden staff. And he began to plead with all the Achaeans,
1.16 and especially the two sons of Atreus, the organizers of the soldiers:
1.17 “Sons of Atreus and also all the well-greaved Achaeans,
1.18 with my blessing may the gods, having homes on Olympus, grant to you
1.19 to sack utterly the city of Priam, and to return homewards well;
1.20 but for me free my beloved child, and accept this ransom,
1.21 showing reverence for the son of Zeus, the far-shooter Apollo.
1.22 At that point indeed all the Achaeans shouted their approval,
1.23 both to treat with decency the sacrifice-leader and to accept the shining ransom;
1.24 However, this was not sweet to Atreus’ son, Agamemnon, in his heart,
1.25 Instead, he dismissed him cruelly.  He began to impose a harsh command:
1.26 “May emphasizing with tone and body language the pronoun “I”) I not come upon you, old man, near the hollow ships,
1.27 either hanging around now or returning back later,
1.28 lest at that time the staff and wreaths of the god may not protect you.
1.29 that woman ( again, emphasizing with tone and body language the pronoun “I”) I will not free, until( Agamemnon emphasizes the next two words as a taunt) old age comes upon her
1.30 in our house in Argos, far from her fatherland,
1.31 working the loom and serving my bed.
1.32 Instead go away! Do not keep provoking me me thus so that you might make your way home more safely than if you remain.
1.33 So he spoke. The old man became frightened. And he began to obey the command.
1.34 He walked  in silence to the shore of the loudly-roaring sea.
1.35 And then, going far away, that old man as god-talker began speaking to
1.36 lord Apollo, he whom light-haired Leto bore:
1.37 “Hear me, silver-bowed one, you who stands guard over Chrysa
1.38 and sacred Cilla, and are lord of Tenedos by force,
1.39 Smintheus, if at any time I roofed over a shrine pleasing to you,
1.40 or if  at any time I completely burned fat thigh-bones for you,
1.41 of bulls and of goats, fulfill this  wish for me:
1.42 may the Danaans pay their respects to my tears with your arrows.
1.43 So he spoke praying. Phoebus Apollo listened to that man .
1.44 Seething with anger in his heart, he came  down from the top of Olympus,
1.45 carrying his bow and his covered quiver on his shoulders.
1.46 The arrows rattled noisily  on the shoulders of the god as he seethed with anger,
1.47 once he himself began to move. That one  made his way like night.
1.48 Then he began to crouch far away from the ships.  He fired an arrow in their midst-
1.49  Fearsome was the rattle from the silver bow.
1.50 First he began to go after the mules and the swift dogs,
1.51 but then, letting fly a sharp arrow against the men themselves,
1.52 he began to strike. The pyres of the corpses, one after another, were kept burning without any break.
1.53 For nine days, to start with, the arrows of the god kept moving up through the camp,
1.54 On the tenth day, however, Achilles summoned the soldiers to an assembly,
1.55 The white-armed goddess Hera, as it happened, placed this within that man’s mind.
1.56 This was the reason: she kept worrying about the Danaans, because  she kept watching them as they died.
1.57 After those  were assembled and so were gathered together,
1.58 swift-footed Achilles, standing up, spoke among them :
1.59 “Son of Atreus, now I believe that we, driven back,
1.60 will return to our homes again- if death, we might flee at all.
1.61 If truly war and plague together will force the Achaeans into submission.
1.62 Instead, come,  let us ask either some seer or sacrifice-leader,
1.63 or even a dream-interpreter, for  a dream is also from Zeus.
1.64 That man may say why Phoebus Apollo became so greatly filled with anger;
1.65 whether  he reproaches us on account of a vow or a sacrifice,
1.66 or if he in any way, having met with the rich aroma of fully-grown sheep and goats,
1.67 would be willing to avert destruction from us.
1.68  Having spoken thus, that man sat down:  among them stood up
1.69 Calchas, son of Thestor, best by far of all  the bird-interpreters,
1.70 who knew the things that are, and the things that will be, and the things that were before,
1.71 and who had led the ships of the Achaeans into Troy
1.72 through his own gift of foresight, which Phoebus Apollo gave to him.
1.73 That man, thinking benevolently for them, addressed the assembly, and spoke in their midst:
1.74 “Achilles, beloved of Zeus, you order me to explain
1.75 the wrath of Apollo, the lord far-shooter:
1.76 therefore( Calchas emphasizes the “I” with his intonation and body language) I will speak. And as for you, take this in and swear to me
1.77 most decidedly that to help me with determination, with your words and with your hands.
1.78 For I truly expect to fill with anger a man, he who greatly
1.79 holds power over all the Argives, and whom the Achaeans obey:
1.80 for the king has more power, whenever he is angry at an inferior man.
1.81 Here’s the reason:  even if, in fact, he would choke down his anger on that one particular day,
1.82 nevertheless just as certainly going forward he holds a grudge in his chest, until he can fulfill it,
1.83 So, as for you, make yourself clear, if you will protect me.
1.84 Swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed that man:
1.85 “Having taken heart fully, give voice to the god’s message, whatever it is you know.
1.86 For by Apollo, beloved of Zeus, and for whom you, Calchas,
1.87 speaking with authority, reveal divine messages to the Danaans,
1.88 no one, with me living and able to see upon this earth,
1.89 will bear upon you heavy hands near the hollow ships-
1.90 not any of all the Danaans together,
1.92  Then  he took courage and he began to speak, the blameless prophet:
1.93 “ Indeed that one finds fault neither with a vow nor a sacrifice,
1.94 but rather, because of the god-talker, the man to whom Agamemnon showed disrespect:
1.95 he did not  free his daughter, nor did he accept the ransom.
1.96  Because of this the far-shooter gave sufferings and he will continue to give still.
1.97 That one certainly will not  first drive off shameful destruction for the Danaans,
1.98 before you give back the bright-eyed girl to her beloved father
1.99 without a price, without a ransom, and lead a holy sacrifice
1.100 to Chrysa: then we, having appeased him, might cause a change of heart.
1.101   That man, having spoken thus, sat down : Then among them stood up
1.102 the warrior son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon,
1.103 stricken with pain. His black heart completely
1.104 begin being filled with rage.  His two eyes became like blazing fire.
1.105 Glaring evilly first of all at Calchas, he spoke:
1.106 “Seer of evil things, you have never yet once said a favorable thing to me:
1.107 these evil things are always dear to you in your heart to prophesy,
1.108 and as for the fortunate, you never yet spoke any word nor accomplished anything.
1.109 And now, speaking on behalf of the gods, you declare among the Danaans
1.110 that, that the far-shooter produces sufferings for them because of this particular thing:
1.111 because I, for my part, was not willing to accept the shining ransom of the girl Chryseis,
1.112 since I very much wish to hold that particular woman
1.113 at home. And in fact  I have come to prefer her over Clytemnestra,
1.114 my lawful wife, since she is not inferior to her-
1.115 not in form, nor in stature, nor  in mind, nor in any respect in the things that she can produce.
1.116 Yet even so I am willing to give her back, if this really is better:
1.117 I, for my part, wish the soldiers to be safe, rather than to be wiped out.
1.118 As for me, prepare a prize appropriate for my rank immediately, so that alone
1.119 of the Argives I am not without a prize, since this is also not fitting.
1.120 After all, each and every one of you see this, don’t you- that my prize goes elsewhere.
1.121 And then swift-footed godly Achilles proceeded to answer him:
1.122 “Son of Atreus, the man with the most glory, and most attached to possessions of all,
1.123 how exactly will the Achaeans, great-hearted give you a prize?
1.124 We do not  know of great common stores lying around anywhere at all.
1.125 Rather, as we all know, the things which we sacked from the cities, these things have been handed out.
1.126 and on the other hand it would also not be fitting for the soldiers to gather together again these clawed-back things things.
1.127 Instead, you for your part now release this girl to the god. On our part, the Achaeans
1.128 will repay you three times, and even four times, over, if Zeus at some point
1.129 may confer the gift to sack completely the well-walled city Troy.
1.130 And answering, the ruler Agamemnon addressed that man:
1.131 “Do not  in this way- although being skillful, godlike Achilles-
1.132 cheat with your mind, since you will not slip past nor persuade me.
1.133 Do you really want- while you yourself are to hold onto your own prize- me, for my part, like this
1.134 to sit still without having one? Are you telling me to give back this particular woman?
1.135  Mind you, if the great-hearted Achaeans will give me a prize,
1.136 having fashioned it exactly according to my heart, so that it will be worth just as much … (Agamemnon uses non-verbal communication -- perhaps a shrug of the shoulders -- to communicate that this would be acceptable)
1.137 But, if they should not make a gift, then I myself, going in person would take possession for myself
1.138 either your prize or that of Ajax, or that of Odysseus.
1.139 Having taken position, I will lead it away. That man  will be angry and stay angry, whomever I would approach.
1.140 That said,  certainly we will return to consider once again these things,
1.141 Now, come. Let us drag a black ship into the divine sea.
1.142 Let us gather within sufficient rowers. A sacrifice
1.143 let us place inside. The beautiful-cheeked Chryseis herself
1.144 we will embark. And let some single counsel-bearing man be the leader,
1.145 either Ajax or Idomeneus or godlike Odysseus,
1.146 or you, Son of Peleus, most outrageous of all men,
1.147 unti, having performed sacrifices, you will appease him, the free-worker.
1.148 Having given dark look  swift-footed Achilles addressed that man,
1.149 “How dare you! You, all clothed in indecency, obsessed by profit,
1.150 how would any of the Achaeans with determination listen to your words,
1.151 either to go on a journey or with his own strength to fight with men?
1.152 That is to be expected: I certainly did not come on account of Trojan spearmen
1.153 here in order to fight, since they are not at fault to me in any way:
1.154 for they did not ever drive away my cattle, nor  my horses,
1.155 nor in warrior-nourishing, fertile Phthia did they ever
1.156 harm the harvest, since there are many things between:
1.157 many  shady mountains and also the roaring sea.
1.158 Instead you, oh unbelievably indecent one, together we followed so that you might rejoice,
1.159 seeking to gain respect for Menelaus and for you, dog-face,
1.160 from the Trojans. Of these things you do not consider at all. Nor do you give a damn-
1.161 And now you make make threats that you yourself to seize for yourself my prize,
1.162 for which I struggled at length, and which the sons of the Achaeans gave to me.
1.163 Certainly I never have a prize equal to yours, whenever the Achaeans
1.164 sack and pillage a well-managed city of the Trojans.
1.165 Instead, you may be sure, the greater part of the miserable fighting
1.166 my hands perform; nevertheless whenever the division of spoils is at hand,
1.167 for you the prize is much greater, while a smaller yet precious prize I for my part
1.168 go on my way carrying upon the ships, after I am exhausted from waging war.
1.169 But now I will go to Phthia, since it is surely much superior
1.170 to go home with the curved ships. With me being disrespected here, I do not plan,
1.171 to ladle out riches and wealth for you.
1.172 And then the lord of men, Agamemnon, began to answer him:
1.173 “By all means run away, if your heart is stirred in that direction.  I, for one, certainly, do not
1.174 plead with you to stay on account of me: beside me, you can be sure, are others as well
1.175 who will respect me- - and most of all, Zeus, the giver of counsel.
1.176 You are the most hateful  to me of the kings fostered by Zeus:
1.177 for competing with others is always dear to you, as are both wars and battles.
1.178 If you are very strong, at some point a god gave this  to you.
1.179 Going home with both your own ships and with your own comrades,
1.180 lord it over the Myrmidons.  And as for me, I don’t give a damn about you,
1.181 nor do I worry about you bearing a grudge. But I will make the following threat to you:
1.182 as Phoebus Apollo is taking away for himself from me Chryseis,
1.183 that woman, you can be sure, I will send on her way with both my own ship and my own comrades.
1.184 For my part, however, I will lead beautiful-cheeked Briseis,
1.185 that  prize of yours, going myself to your resting-place, so that you will clearly see
1.186 how greatly I am superior to you, and another man as well will fear
1.187 to declare himself an equal to me, and to treat himself as a peer to my face.
1.188 So he spoke. And pain materialized in the son of Peleus. The heart
1.189 in his hairy chest was torn in two directions:
1.190 whether HE having drawn for himself the sharp sword from beside his thigh,
1.191 would  make the men stand back while he for his part would kill the son of Atreus,
1.192 or he could stop his anger and restrain his heart.
1.193 As he was turning over these things through his thoughts and through his heart,
1.194 he was beginning to pull for himself  out of its sheath a great sword, but Athena came
1.195 from heaven. The reason for this was that the white-armed goddess Hera sent her forth,
1.196 both caring about and concerned for the both men equally in her heart.
1.197 She stood  behind him, and by his light hair she gripped the son of Peleus,
1.198 making herself visible to him alone. No one of the others  could see.
1.199 Achilles was astonished , and turned himself around. And right then and there he recognized
1.200 Pallas Athena. and her two eyes appeared terrifying.
1.201  Having addressed her, he began to give voice to winged words:
1.202 “There you are! Why, daughter of aegis-holding Zeus, have you come?
1.203 Is it  so that you might see for yourself the outrageous behavior of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?
1.204 Whatever the answer I will tell you something. And this as well I expect to be fulfilled:
1.205 by his outrageous actions soon he will destroy his life.
1.206 Then to him the goddess spoke, owl-eyed Athena:
1.207 “I, for my part, came in order to stop this rage of yours- - if you might obey-
1.208 down from the heavens. The white-armed goddess Hera sent me forth,
1.209 both caring about and concerned for both equally in her heart.
1.210 Instead, come on. Step away from this quarrel. Do not keep drawing for yourself the sword in your hand.
1.211 Instead, by all means, with words as much as you please paint him a nasty picture of how he can be sure it will be:
1.212 Because I will tell you how this is is. And as well this will in reality be fulfilled.
1.213 In the future, there will be present in your possession three times as many shining gifts
1.214 because of the outrageous behavior that we see here. As for you, hold yourself back. Listen to to us.
1.215 And, replying, swift-footed Achilles said to her:
1.216 “Of course, goddess, it is necessary to heed a statement from the two of you,
1.217 even though really filled up with anger in one’ s heart. For it is better this way.
1.218 Whoever obeys the gods, they really  listen to that man.
1.219 He spoke. And on the silver hilt he held his heavy hand,
1.220 Back into the sheath he shoved the great sword, and he did not disobey
1.221 the command of Athena. But as for that goddess, she had already departed to Olympus,
1.222 into the home of aegis-holding Zeus among the other divinities.
1.223 The son of Peleus  yet again with harsh words
1.224 spoke to the son of Atreus. And he was not yet stepping away from his anger;
1.225 “Swollen with wine, having the eyes of a dog but the heart of a deer,
1.226 never to arm yourself for battle together with the army,
1.227 nor ever to enter an ambush  with the most outstanding of the Achaeans
1.228 have you had the fortitude in your heart. That seems to you to be death.
1.229 Surely it is much more preferable along the broad camp of the Achaeans
1.230 to take away for yourself gifts from whoever may have speak against you.
1.231 You are a king who devours his people, because you lord over nobodies!
1.232 For truly, son of Atreus, you would now have acted abusively for the last time.
1.233 Instead I will explain to you, and besides I will swear a great oath.
1.234 Truly by this very staff, which never in truth will sprout leaves and branches,
1.235 after  it first left behind its stump in the mountains, For the bronze stripped it all around
1.237 both the leaves and the bark. Now, however, the sons of the Achaeans,
1.238 acting as judges, carry it in their palms, they who
1.239  defend the laws of the cosmos on behalf of Zeus. This  will be a great oath to you.
1.240 In the future certainly a desire for Achilles will come upon the sons of the Achaeans
1.241 each and every one of them! And then you, though stricken with pain, will not have the power
1.242 to provide protection in the least, when many fall dying at the hands of Hector the man-slaughterer.
1.243 You  will gouge open your own heart within,
1.244 consumed with fury because you showed respect in no way to the best of the Achaeans.
1.245 So spoke the son of Peleus. And he flung against the ground the staff,
1.246 drilled with golden studs. And he himself began to sit.
1.247 And the son of Atreus from the other side continued in wrath. And among them Nestor,
1.248 pleasing in speech lept up, the articulate assembly-speaker of the Pylians,
1.249 and from that man’s tongue speech began to flow, sweeter than honey.
1.250 Already for him already two generations of mortal men
1.251 had passed away, who previously along with him were raised and born
1.252 in most holy Pylos. And now, he was lord among the third generation.
1.253 He, thinking constructively for them, addressed the assembly and spoke in their midst:
1.254 “I can’t believe it! For sure great sorrow has reached the Achaean land;
1.255 You can be sure Priam would rejoice, as would the children of Priam,
1.256 while the other Trojans would filled with pleasure greatly in their hearts,
1.257 if they should hear about all these things here, about the two of you fighting,
1.258 you who are above  the Danaans in planning, and above in fighting.
1.259 Stop it! Listen to me! - the two of you both  are younger than I am:
1.260 For as for me, already at times, with men even better than you both,
1.261 spent my time. And not once would] those men, you may be sure, dismiss me.
1.262 Let me tell you, never have I seen, nor would I see with my own eyes, such men,
1.263 such as Peirithous and Dryas, the shepherd of the soldiers,
1.264 and Caeneus and Exadius and also godlike Polyphemus,
1.265 and the son of Aegeus’ son, Theseus, a man like the immortals.
1.266 those were brought up as the mightiest  of the men on earth.
1.267 Let me make this point clear: they were the mightiest. And they would fight against the mightiest-
1.268 against mountain-dwelling centaurs. And utterly they annihilated them.
1.269 First, I used to spend my time among those men, having come from Pylos,
1.270 from far away, from a distant land. Why did I come? Because  called for me.
1.271 And I would fight on my own with my own two hands- I did that! And let me make this point clear as well, with those men (gesturing in the distance to emphasize the separation from the present)  no one of those
1.272 who are now mortals on this earth could put up a fight.
1.273 But you may be sure, they paid attention to my plans and they would listen to my recommendations.
1.274 And so now, listen to me- - and I mean you (plural, addressing Agamemnon and Achilles both)! -- because to listen is better.
1.275 As for you (singular, addressing Agamemnon), high-ranking though you are- do not take away for yourself the girl from this man here.
1.276 Instead, leave it just as at first the sons of Achaeans gave the prize to him;
1.277 And as for you, do not, son of Peleus, choose to compete with a king,
1.278 pitting your strength against his, since
1.279 a staff-holding king, to whom  Zeus gave renown never has received possession of a position of respect that is comparable.
1.280 If  you are stronger, a goddess  as mother bore you,
1.281 nevertheless he still is superior since he is lord over more people.
1.282 Son of Atreus, as for you, stop your rage: look! I, for my part,
1.283 I beg you to let go of your anger towards Achilles, he who to all
1.284 the Achaeans is a great defense in cruel war.
1.285 And, answering him, ruling Agamemnon spoke:
1.286 “ Sure enough,  you said all these things  rightly, old man.
1.287 But this man here wishes to be above all others.
1.288 Not only does he desire to be stronger than everyone, but also to be lord over everyone,
1.289 and to give orders to everyone. As far as these things are concerned, I don’t expect anyone to listen.
1.290 If  the gods, existing always, made him a spearman,
1.291 for that reason do they allow him to publicly deliver insults?
1.292 But then, interrupting, godlike Achilles began to answer him:
1.293 “Surely  I would be called both a coward and a nobody,
1.294 if  I will yield to you in each action, whatever you might say.
1.295 To other men, for all I care, make these commands. Because, to me, you can be sure, don’t
1.296 give any orders. In fact I, for my part, do not expect to listen to you in the future.
1.297 And I will tell you another thing. You for your part,  deposit it into your heart:
1.298 indeed I will not fight against  you with my hands on account of the girl-
1.299 not with you, not with any other man- - since you (pl), having given her, now take her away for yourselves from me .
1.300 But as for the other things, which are in my possession beside the swift black ship,
1.301 of these things you may not carry away anything, having picked it up with me unwilling.
1.302 But come on- really, try for yourself, so that these men here as well may learn-
1.303 your dark blood will pour out right then and there around my spear.
1.304 Thus the two of them , having fought with such opposing speeches,
1.305 they stood up, and they dismissed the assembly beside the ships of the Achaeans.
1.306 The son of Peleus, on the one hand, went on his way towards the resting-places and the well-balanced ships
1.307 with both the son of Menoetius and his comrades.
1.308 Meanwhile, the son of Atreus  dragged forward a swift ship to the sea.
1.309 And therein he selected twenty rowers. And a sacrifice
1.310 for the god he embarked, and up into the ship
1.311 he, leading, seated the beautiful-cheeked Chryseis. And in went as leader the adaptable Odysseus.
1.312 Then they, or on their side, having embarked, began to sail over the watery routes,
1.313 while the son of Atreus commanded the soldiers to purify themselves.
1.314 Those  began purifying  themselves. And they flinging the impurities into the sea.
1.315 Then they began to perform potent sacrifices for Apollo,
1.316 of bulls and of goats, along the shore of the barren sea:
1.317 and the aroma reached the heavens, swirling about in the smoke.
1.318 In this way they  began working on these things down throughout the camp. But, Agamemnon was not
1.319 stepping away from the competition which he first threatened against Achilles,
1.320 Instead he  spoke to both Talthybius and Eurybates,
1.321 those two who were his heralds and ready attendants:
1.322 “You two go to the resting-place of Peleus’ son, Achilles.
1.323 After seizing beautiful-cheeked Briseis by the hand, bring her.
1.324 If  he should not give her, then I myself person would seize her for myself,
1.325 having come with an more men. And for him that will be more to be feared.
1.326 Having spoken thus, he sent them forth. He imposed the cruel command.
1.327 the two, unwilling,  both walked along the shore of the barren sea,
1.328 The two of them arrived at both the resting-places and the ships of the Myrmidons.
1.329 2274292b That man they found beside both his resting-place and his black ship,
1.330 sitting. Nor did Achilles rejoice at all having caught sight of those two.
1.331 On the one hand, the two men, terrified at, and feeling shame before, the king,
1.332 stood there. but They did not begin to address him about anything nor did they ask any questions.
1.333 For his part that man understood the situation in his heart and spoke:
1.334 “Welcome, heralds, messengers of Zeus and also of men,
1.335 Come closer. Don’t worry, you are not to be responsible to me for anything: instead Agamemnon is,
1.336 the one who sent you two forth on account of the girl Briseis.(
1.337 Achilles turns to Patroclus) Come, Zeus-born Patroclus, bring out the girl
1.338 and give her to these two to lead away. And let these two themselves be witnesses
1.339 both before the blessed gods and before mortal people,
1.340 and before that unfeeling king, if some day  again
1.341 need of me should arise to defend against shameful destruction
1.342 for those others. For surely he is out of control, with a self-destructive heart,
1.343  He does not at all understand how to plan for the future and the past together
1.344 so that the Achaeans might in the future fight besides the ships, safe under his watch.
1.345 So he spoke, and Patroclus began to obey his beloved companion;
1.346  he led the beautiful-cheeked Bryseis out of the resting-place,
1.347 and he gave her to lead away. The two of them  went back along the ships of the Achaeans,
1.348 and that person, the woman, unwilling, started on her way along with those people. As for Achilles,
1.349 having started to cry, he at once took a seat far away from his companions, sinking down
1.350 upon the shore of the gray saltwater and gazing out upon the boundless sea.
1.351 And he  at length as god-talker spoke to to his beloved mother, stretching out his hands:
1.352 “Mother, since you did after all give birth to me, although being destined for a short life,
1.353 a position commanding appropriate respect, at the very least, the Olympian ought to extend to me-
1.354 Zeus thundering on high. But now not even a little did he show respect to me.
1.355 That is clearly the case because, in truth, the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon,
1.356 has shown disrespect to me. For, having snatched my prize, he holds it- - he himself having stolen it.
1.357 So he spoke, shedding tears. That man his revered mother heard,
1.358 sitting in the depths of the sea beside her father, an old man.
1.359 Swiftly  she rose up from the gray sea like the mist,
1.360 and  before that man, with him shedding tears, she sat down
1.361 With her hand she caressed him and she also spoke, and began speaking to him by name:
1.362 “ Son, why are you crying? What  sorrow reached your heart?
1.363 Speak out- - do not conceal it in your mind! --  so that we both might know.
1.364 Groaning deeply, he answered her , the swift-footed Achilles:
1.365 “ You know- why then should I list all these things to you, who already know?
1.366 We made our way into Thebes, the sacred city of Eetion.
1.367 That city we sacked from one end to the other, and we also led everything here.
1.368 And while these things the sons of the Achaeans divided up well among themselves:
1.369 And they took out the beautiful-cheeked daughter of Chryses for the son of Atreus.
1.370 But then Chryses, the sacrifice-leader of the far-shooter Apollo,
1.371 came to the swift ships of the bronze-wearing Achaeans
1.372 in order to free  his daughter, bearing  boundless ransom,
1.373 holding the wreaths of the far-shooter Apollo in his hands
1.374 aloft on his golden staff. And he began to plead with all the Achaeans,
1.375 and especially with the two sons of Atreus, the organizers of the soldiers.
1.376 At that point indeed all the other Achaeans responded approvingly,
1.377 both to treat with decency the sacrifice-leader and to accept the shining ransom.
1.378 However, this was not sweet to the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, in his heart.
1.379 Instead, he dismissed him cruelly.  He began to impose upon him a harsh command.
1.380  The old man, seething with anger, made his way back. and to him, after he had begun his prayer,
1.381 Apollo listened, because Chryses was very dear to him.
1.382 And he fired an evil arrow against the Argives. Now those soldiers,
1.383 one after another, kept dying. And those arrows of the god kept flying in
1.384 on every side up through the wide camp of the Achaeans. To us  the prophet,
1.385 thinking benevolently, began to publicly deliver the prophecies of the far-shooter.
1.386 Immediately I was the one who first began to urge that we should appease the god.
1.387 But then anger took hold of the son of Atreus, Instantly after standing up
1.388 he gave a threatening command, which  has been brought to completion.
1.389 Here is what I mean: that woman, to begin with, the quick-eyed Achaeans with a swift ship
1.390 send to Chryses, At the same time, they bring gifts for the lord.
1.391 But this other woman just now the heralds went on their way, leading her away from my resting-place-
1.392 the daughter of Briseus, the woman whom the sons of the Achaeans gave to me.
1.393 But if you really have the power, protect your noble son.
1.394 Having gone to Olympus, plead with Zeus, if at any time  in any way
1.395 either by what you have said or in fact by what you have done you cheered the heart of Zeus.
1.396 For often in the great rooms of your father I have heard you
1.397 boasting, when you stated that for black-clouded son of Cronos
1.398 you alone among the immortals fought off shameful destruction,
1.399 when the other Olympians wished to tie him up,
1.400 both Hera and Poseidon and even Pallas Athena.
1.401 But you, goddess, having come, released that one from his chains,
1.402 having immediately called the hundred-handed one into great Olympus,
1.403 he whom the gods call Briareus, and all men
1.404 Aegaeon. For that one, in turn, is better than his father in terms of physical strength.
1.405 He then sat down beside the son of Cronos, basking in his aura of power.
1.406 And before him they cowered the blessed gods. So they did not still tie him up.
1.407 Now, having reminded him of these things, sit at his side and take hold of his knees,
1.408 if somehow he might be willing to bring aid upon the Trojans,
1.409 and to squeeze together the Achaeans both down among their ships’ decks, and around the sea,
1.410 as they are killed, so that all may enjoy the full benefit of their king;
1.411 and the son of Atreus, widely-ruling Agamemnon, also may recognize
1.412 his own self-destructive stupidity, in that he showed no respect to the best of the Achaeans.
1.413 And Thetis, pouring down tears, then began to answer him:
1.414 “(sighing deeply) My son, why did I take the time to raise you- I, after bearing you for awful things?
1.415 I wish you might be able, beside the ships, without tears and without suffering,
1.416 to remain quietly! since, even now, the fate assigned to you is brief as it is, is not very long at all.
1.417 But now, you are, simultaneously, both doomed to die soon and unhappy beyond all people
1.418 So it was for an evil destiny that I gave birth to you in the great rooms.
1.419 To present this  statement for you to Zeus, who delights in thunderbolt,
1.420 I, in person, will go to snow-covered Olympus in the hopes that he may be persuaded.
1.421 But as for you, now sitting beside the swift-sailing ships,
1.422 continue in wrath against the Achaeans. Put a stop to your actions away from war completely.
1.423 For Zeus yesterday went into Oceanus to the midst of the blameless Ethiopians,
1.424 on account of a feast All the gods began to follow along.
1.425 But on the twelfth day he will come back again to Olympus.
1.426 And at that time, then on your behalf I will go to the bronze-floored house of Zeus,
1.427 and I will clasp him by his knees. And I expect to make my case successfully to him.
1.428 Having spoken thus  she went away. That one  she left then and there,
1.429 filled with anger throughout his heart because of the well-girdled woman,
1.430 she whom  they were stealing by force with him being unwilling. As for Odysseus,
1.431 he was on his way to Chrysa, bringing a sacred sacrifice.
1.432 When they   entered within the very deep harbor
1.433 first they took in their sails, then they placed them in the black ship.
1.434 Then they guided the mast to the mast-holder having lowered it with ropes
1.435 quickly.
1.436 And out they cast the anchors. They tied down the boat’s stern-cables;
1.437 2274351 As for the men themselves they made their way out at the edge of the sea.
1.438 They disembarked the sacrifice for the far-shooter Apollo;
1.439 And out of the sea-faring ship Chryseis walked.
1.440 And then at that point Odysseus, a man of many counsels, leading her up to the altar,
1.441 put her in her beloved father’s hands. And he spoke to him:
1.442 “ Chryses, the lord of men sent me forth, Agamemnon,
1.443 both to lead your child to you and to perform a sacred sacrifice for Phoebus
1.444 on behalf of the Danaans, so that we may appease the lord,
1.445 he who now has set in motion grievous troubles to the Argives.
1.446 Having spoken in this way, he placed her in his hands. And that man, rejoicing, received
1.447 his beloved daughter. Quickly the sacred sacrifice for the  god
1.448 they made stand in a row about the well-built altar.
1.449 Then they purified their hands with water and picked up in their hands ground barley.
1.450 Then among them Chryses, having raised his hands, began to pray loudly:
1.451 “Listen to me, silver-bowed one, you who encircled Chrysa
1.452 and sacred Cilla, and are lord of Tenedos by force.
1.453 Just as certainly  once before you listened to me when I had prayed,
1.454 and just as certainly you conferred respect upon me, at you also greatly harmed the soldiers of the Achaeans.
1.455 And still even now, for me fulfill in addition the following wish:
1.456 Right this minute, now, drive way shameful destruction from the Danaans.
1.457 So he spoke, praying, and Phoebus Apollo listened to him.
1.458 But then after they prayed and cast forth the ground barley,
1.459 they first pulled back  the heads of the offerings, and then slaughtered and flayed them.
1.460 They cut away the thighs  and wrapped up and down them in fat,
1.461 having made it double-folded. Then they placed raw meat on top of the thigh pieces themselves.
1.462 The old man began to burn them on skewers. Then he began to pour flashing wine on.
1.463 The young men  next to him were holding five-pronged forks in their hands.
1.464 After a while when the thigh pieces were burned thoroughly and they tasted the organs,
1.465 they began to cut up  the rest and also pierced them with spits through both sides;
1.466 they skillfully roasted  them, and pulled off for themselves everything.
1.467 After a while, when they stopped themselves from work and prepared for themselves the feast,
1.468 they kept sharing the feast, nor was their heart lacking in any way from the evenly-divided feast.
1.469 After a while, when they rid themselves of the desire for drink and for food,
1.470 the young men first for themselves they filled to the brim mixing-bowls with drink,
1.471 then they distributed  this to everyone, having made the initial libations with the drinking-cups.
1.472 Those men  throughout the entire day continued to appease the god through song and dance,
1.473 the elite young men of the Achaeans singing the beautiful song to Apollo,
1.474 celebrating with song the far-shooter. And that one, listening, was pleased in his heart.
1.475 And when the sun sank and dusk arrived,
1.476 then  they lay themselves down to sleep beside the stern-cables of the ship.
1.477 And when early-born, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared,
1.478 right at that time then they began bringing themselves back to the midst of the broad camp of the Achaeans.
1.479 For them  the far-shooter Apollo set in motion a favorable wind.
1.480 And as for those men, they stood up for themselves the mast and spread high and wide the white sails.
1.481 Wind swelled the sail in its center. And on both sides a wave,
1.482 surging, was splashing against the front of the ship, as it travelled.
1.483 And that ship, making time through its path, kept running over the wave.
1.484 And then, after  they arrived at the broad camp of the Achaeans,
1.485 first they pulled the black ship onto land,
1.486 far up upon the sandy shore, and then they laid out the long supports underneath.
1.487 Then the men themselves began to scatter throughout both the resting-places and
1.488 Meanwhile that man remained filled with wrath, sitting alongside his swift-sailing ships-
1.489 the descendent of Zeus, son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles:
1.490 Neither did he ever resume his habit of entering into the assembly that brings glory to men,
1.491 nor into war. Instead he kept wearing and wearing away his beloved heart,
1.492 remaining right where he was. He kept longing and longing for both the battle-shout and war.
1.493 However   from that point, when the twelfth dawn took place
1.494 then   the gods, existing always, went to Olympus,
1.495 all of them at the same time. Zeus was leading the way. Thetis  was not forgetful of the demands
1.496 of her own son- Far from it: that woman rose up over a wave of the sea.
1.497 In the early morning  she went up to great heaven and Olympus.
1.498 She found  the far-seeing son of Cronos sitting apart from the others,
1.499 on the highest summit of many-peaked Olympus.
1.500 And so then she sat down before Zeus himself, and she laid hold of his knees
1.501 with her left hand, and  with her right hand she gripped beneath his chin,
1.502 pleading with him, she addressed the lord Zeus, son of Cronos:
1.503 “Father Zeus, if at any time  I among the immortals helped you,
1.504 either by word or by deed, fulfill this wish for me:
1.505 treat my son with proper respect, he who was doomed to the most swift death of others. Instead, now  the lord of men Agamemnon
1.507 has shown disrespect to him. For he, having snatched his prize, holds it- - he himself having stolen it.
1.508 Instead you for your part, I beg you, show proper respect for him, all-wise Olympian Zeus:
1.509 so long  place in the possession the Trojans superior strength, until the Achaeans
1.510 show proper respect to my son and glorify him with a position of respect.
1.511 So she spoke, and he did not address her at all, Zeus the cloud-summoner.
1.512 Rather, in silence he remained motionless for a long time. And as Thetis took hold for herself his knees,
1.513 in this way she kept holding herself on, having attached herself on him. And again a second time she began to petition him:
1.514 “Promise most faithfully to me, and nod your head in approval,
1.515 or refuse, since for you fear does not exist, so that I may know well
1.516 how greatly I am the most disrespected goddess among all.
1.517 That woman , he answered, greatly agitated, , Zeus the cloud-summoner:
1.518 “Without a doubt  these deeds are destructive, since you will push me to stir up a fight
1.519 Hera, when she would torment me with insulting words.
1.520 And  to be sure in the same manner, among the immortal gods, with me always
1.521 she picks fights. And she even claims that I support the Trojans in battle.
1.522 But as for you, first, go back now, lest she should become aware of anything,
1.523 Hera. Then these things will be an an object of concern for me until I am completely finished with it.
1.524 But come- I will nod my approval to you with my head so that you may have settled confidence.
1.525 As you know, this from me is truly the greatest sign among the immortals.
1.526 for mine is not to be taken back, nor something that can deceive,
1.527 nor can it go unfulfilled- - whatever I may nod my approval to with my head.
1.528 He spoke, And with his dark brows, he gave the nod of approval, the son of Cronos.
1.529 And  his divine hair flowed down from the lord’s
1.530 immortal head. And he shook great Olympus.
1.531 Then the two, having planned together in this way, separated. Then, she, for her part,
1.532 lept from glittering Olympus into the deep sea,
1.533 while Zeus went to his own home. All the gods stood up at the same time
1.534 from their seats in front of their father; not one of them had the nerve
1.535 to stay in their place as he was approaching. Instead facing him in greeting, they stood- - each and every one of them.
1.536 So there indeed he sat down on his throne. But Hera, when she had seen him, did not
1.537 fail to understand that she had fashioned plans together with him,
1.538 silver-footed Thetis, the daughter of the old man of the sea.
1.539 Right then and there with cutting words she began to address Zeus, the son of Cronos:
1.540 “Who  of the gods fashioned plans together with you, devious one, this time?
1.541 It is always dear to you being far away from me,
1.542 thinking secret things to pass judgment on.
1.544  Then he began to answer her, the father of both men and of gods:
1.545 “Hera, do not  expect to know all my decisions:
1.546 they will be too difficult for you, despite being my wife.
1.547 This is how it is. Of course, whatever  is fitting to hear, then not anyone,
1.548 neither any of the gods nor of humans will know that decision before you.
1.549 But, that said, whatever decision I, for my part, might choose to think through separately from the gods,
1.550 Do not in any way as for, you, for your part- do not in any way pose questions about or inquire after each and every one of these things.
1.551 Then  she began to answer him, the ox-eyed, revered Hera:
1.552 “You are the worst, son of Cronos, what sort of command was that which you said?
1.553  Up until now indeed I neither question you constantly, nor do I make inquiries.
1.554 But you, very much at-ease, plan these things however you should choose.
1.555 And now I am filled with fear horribly down through my heart, that she may have convinced you,
1.556 silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea.
1.557 For in the early morning she seated herself beside you and took hold of your knees.
1.558 To her, I think that you actually nodded in approval so that
1.559 you would show respect to Achilles, and you would destroy many of the Achaeans beside the ships.
1.560 Answering,  cloud-summoner Zeus addressed her:
1.561 “You are out of your mind! You always  are calculating. And never do I slip past you.
1.562 All the same,  you will not be able to accomplish anything. Instead from my heart
1.563 you will be much more distant. And this will be even more to be feared by you.
1.564 If  this is like this, it is going to be pleasing to me.
1.565 Instead, sit in silence! Obey my command,
1.566 or else however many gods that are in Olympus now would not protect you
1.567 from me, coming close, when I would set invincible hands in motion against you.
1.568 So he spoke. And she became frightened, the ox-eyed, revered Hera.
1.569 So in silence she sat down, clamping down on her beloved heart.
1.570 Throughout the house of Zeus the heavenly gods were made upset.
1.571 Among them  Hephaestus, celebrated for his ability to make things, began to speak to the group
1.572 conveying pleasing things to his beloved mother, white-armed Hera:
1.573 “Without a doubt  these deeds will be destructive, and they will not be tolerable any longer
1.574 if  you two quarrel in this way because of mortals
1.575 and stir up a brawl among the gods. Nor will there be any
1.576 enjoyment of this good feast, since the worse win.
1.577 To my mother I for my part give this advice , even though she can think for herself:
1.578 to convey pleasing things to my beloved father Zeus, so that
1.579 my father would not fight again and disturb the feast along with us.
1.580 For there is indeed the possibility that the Olympian of lightning would choose
1.581 to shove us out of our seats. That one, as we all know, is the one who can generate the most force by far.
1.582 Instead, you on your end, addressing that man with soft words.
1.583 Immediately then the Olympian will be gracious to us.
1.584 He spoke  thus. And, having lept up,
1.585 he placed a two-handled cup in his dear mother’s hand. And he spoke to her:
1.586 “Be strong, my mother. And hold yourself up, although being troubled,
1.587 lest I may see in my eyes you, beloved as you are,
1.588 being beaten. And then I will not be able, though stricken with pain,
1.589 to offer protection in any way. As you know, the Olympian is very hard to set oneself against.
1.590 For before now, also at another time as I was attempting to defend you,
1.591 he flung me, having seized my foot, down from the divine threshold.
1.592 Throughout the entire day I was propelled. Along with  the setting sun
1.593 I ended my downward fall on Lemnos. But still a little spirit was still present within.
1.594 There the Sintian men straight away took care of me, after having fallen.
1.595 So he spoke. And white-armed goddess Hera smiled.
1.596 And, after having smiled, she accepted from her child the cup in her hand.
1.597 As for him, that one, starting from the left and moving to the right, for all the other gods
1.598 began to pour out wine, drawing sweet nectar out of the mixing-bowl;
1.599 Laughter too loud to be drowned out  then was stirred up among the blessed gods,
1.600 as they saw Hephaestus bustling through the house.
1.601 Then in this manner all day, until the sun had set,
1.602 they kept sharing the feast. Neither was their heart lacking anything of the equally-divided feast,
1.603 nor indeed of the outstandingly beautiful lyre, which Apollo was holding,
1.604 nor of the Muses, who were singing, taking turns, with a beautiful voice.
1.605 And then, after the shining light of the sun sank down,
1.606 the rest of them  each went to their home in order to lie down,
1.607 where for each the widely-renowned and crippled in both feet
1.608 Hephaestus made a house, with his knowing mind.
1.609 And Olympian Zeus, god of lightning, made his way to his bed.
1.610 There formerly he used to rest himself when sweet sleep might come to him.
1.611 There, having ascended, he lay down to sleep. And at his side was golden-throned Hera.
