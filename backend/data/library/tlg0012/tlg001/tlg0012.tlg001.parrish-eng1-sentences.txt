1.s1 Sing, goddess, the godlike wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus, that sociopathic wrath
1.s2 that caused countless pains for the Achaeans.
1.s3 It hurled to Hades many precious lives of warriors.
1.s4 And it began to make their bodies into picked-over scraps for dogs and for birds, all of them;
1.s5 and the plan of Zeus began to be fulfilled,
1.s6 from the point where  first, the two having both begun a competition with each other, both of them faced off, the son of Atreus, lord of men, and god-like Achilles.
1.s7 Who  then of the gods threw together the two of them to fight in competition with one another?
1.s8 The son of Leto and of Zeus:
1.s9 for that one, filled with anger at the king, set in motion an evil sickness up through the camp.
1.s10 And the soldiers began to be killed, because he showed disrespect to that man Chryses, the god-talker. What man? -- the son of Atreus.
1.s11 Here is what happened: a man, came to the swift ships of the Achaeans in order to free  his daughter and bearing boundless ransom, holding the wreaths of the far-shooter Apollo in his hands high up on his golden staff.
1.s12 And he began to plead with all the Achaeans, and especially with the two sons of Atreus, the organizers of the soldiers:
1.s13 “Sons of Atreus and also all the well-greaved Achaeans, with my blessing may the gods, having homes on Olympus, confer gift on you to sack utterly the city of Priam, and to return homewards well;
1.s14 but for me free my beloved child, and accept this ransom, showing reverence for the son of Zeus, the far-shooter Apollo.
1.s15 At that point indeed all the Achaeans shouted their approval, both to treat with decency the sacrifice-leader and to accept the shining ransom;
1.s16 However, this was not sweet to Atreus’ son, Agamemnon, in his heart,
1.s17 Instead, he dismissed him cruelly.
1.s18  He began to impose a harsh command:
1.s19 “May( emphasizing with tone and body language the pronoun “I”) I not come upon you, old man, near the hollow ships, either hanging around now or returning back later, lest even at that time the staff and wreaths of the god may not protect you.
1.s20 that woman ( again, emphasizing with tone and body language the pronoun “I”) I will not free,
1.s21 until( Agamemnon emphasizes the next two words as a taunt) old age comes upon her in our house in Argos, far from her fatherland, working the loom and serving my bed.
1.s22 Instead go away!
1.s23 Do not keep provoking me me thus so that you might make your way home more safely than if you remain.
1.s24 So he spoke.
1.s25 The old man became frightened.
1.s26 And he began to obey the command.
1.s27 He walked  in silence to the shore of the loudly-roaring sea.
1.s28 And then, going far away, that old man as god-talker began speaking to lord Apollo, he whom light-haired Leto bore:
1.s29 “Hear me, silver-bowed one, you who stands guard over Chrysa and sacred Cilla, and are lord of Tenedos by force,
1.s30 Smintheus, if at any time I roofed over a shrine pleasing to you, or if  at any time I completely burned fat thigh-bones for you, of bulls and of goats, fulfill this  wish for me:
1.s31 may the Danaans pay their respects to my tears with your arrows.
1.s32 So he spoke praying.
1.s33 Phoebus Apollo listened to that man .
1.s34 Seething with anger in his heart, he came  down from the top of Olympus, carrying his bow and his covered quiver on his shoulders.
1.s35 The arrows rattled noisily  on the shoulders of the god as he seethed with anger, once he himself began to move.
1.s36 That one  made his way like night.
1.s37 Then he began to crouch far away from the ships.
1.s38 He fired an arrow in their midst-
1.s39 Fearsome was the rattle from the silver bow.
1.s40 First he began to go after the mules and the swift dogs,
1.s41 but then, letting fly a sharp arrow against the men themselves, he began to strike.
1.s42 The pyres of the corpses, one after another, were kept burning without any break.
1.s43 For nine days, to start with, the arrows of the god kept moving up through the camp,
1.s44 On the tenth day, however, Achilles summoned the soldiers to an assembly,
1.s45 The white-armed goddess Hera, as it happened, placed this within that man’s mind.
1.s46 This was the reason: she kept worrying about the Danaans, because  she kept watching them as they died.
1.s47 After those  were assembled and so were gathered together, swift-footed Achilles, standing up, spoke among them :
1.s48 “Son of Atreus, now I believe that we, driven back, will return to our homes again- if death, we might flee at all. If truly war and plague together will force the Achaeans into submission.
1.s49 Instead, come,  let us ask either some seer or sacrifice-leader, or even a dream-interpreter, for  a dream is also from Zeus. That man may say why Phoebus Apollo became so greatly filled with anger; whether  he reproaches us on account of a vow or a sacrifice, or if he in any way, having met with the rich aroma of Amelia Parrish 2020-08-04T17:28:24 'fully-grown' from 'telos' origins; where is 'without a spot or blemish' reflected in the greek? fully-grown sheep and goats, would be willing to avert destruction from us.
1.s50  Having spoken thus, that man sat down:
1.s51  among them stood up Calchas, son of Thestor, best by far of all the bird-interpreters, who knew the things that are, and the things that will be, and the things that were before, and who had led the ships of the Achaeans into Troy through his own gift of foresight, which Phoebus Apollo gave to him.
1.s52 That man, thinking benevolently for them, addressed the assembly, and spoke in their midst:
1.s53 “Achilles, beloved of Zeus, you order me to explain the wrath of Apollo, the lord far-shooter:
1.s54 therefore( Calchas emphasizes the “I” with his intonation and body language) I will speak.
1.s55 And as for you, take this in
1.s56 and swear to me most decidedly that to help me with determination, with your words and with your hands.
1.s57 For I truly expect to fill with anger a man, he who greatly holds power over all the Argives, and whom the Achaeans obey:
1.s58 for the king has more power, whenever he is angry at an inferior man.
1.s59 Here’s the reason:  even if, in fact, he would choke down his anger on that one particular day, nevertheless just as certainly going forward he holds a grudge in his chest, until he can fulfill it,
1.s60 So, as for you, make yourself clear, if you will protect me.
1.s61 Swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed that man:
1.s62 “Having taken heart fully, give voice to the god’s message, whatever it is you know.
1.s63 For by Apollo, beloved of Zeus, and for whom you, Calchas, speaking with authority, reveal divine messages to the Danaans, no one, with me living and able to see upon this earth, will bear upon you heavy hands near the hollow ships- not any of all the Danaans together, not even you are speaking about Agamemnon, he who boasts to be by far the best of the Achaeans.
1.s64  Then  he took courage
1.s65 and he began to speak, the blameless prophet:
1.s66 “ Indeed that one finds fault neither with a vow nor a sacrifice, but rather, because of the god-talker, the man to whom Agamemnon showed disrespect:
1.s67 he did not  free his daughter, nor did he accept the ransom.
1.s68  Because of this the far-shooter gave sufferings and he will continue to give still.
1.s69 That one certainly will not  first drive off shameful destruction for the Danaans, before you give back the bright-eyed girl to her beloved father without a price, without a ransom, and lead a holy sacrifice to Chrysa:
1.s70 then we, having appeased him, might cause a change of heart.
1.s71 That man, having spoken thus, sat down :
1.s72 Then among them stood up the warrior son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, stricken with pain.
1.s73 His black heart completely begin being filled with rage.
1.s74 His two eyes became like blazing fire.
1.s75 Glaring evilly first of all at Calchas, he spoke:
1.s76 “Seer of evil things, you have never yet once said a favorable thing to me:
1.s77 these evil things are always dear to you in your heart to prophesy,
1.s78 and as for the fortunate, you never yet spoke any word nor accomplished anything.
1.s79 And now, speaking on behalf of the gods, you declare among the Danaans that, that the far-shooter produces sufferings for them because of this particular thing: because I, for my part, was not willing to accept the shining ransom of the girl Chryseis, since I very much wish to hold that particular woman at home.
1.s80 And in fact  I have come to prefer her over Clytemnestra, my lawful wife, since she is not inferior to her- not in form, nor in stature, nor  in mind, nor in any respect in the things that she can produce.
1.s81 Yet even so I am willing to give her back, if this really is better:
1.s82 I, for my part, wish the soldiers to be safe, rather than to be wiped out.
1.s83 As for me, prepare a prize appropriate for my rank immediately, so that alone of the Argives I am not without a prize, since this is also not fitting.
1.s84 After all, each and every one of you see this, don’t you- that my prize goes elsewhere.
1.s85 And then swift-footed godly Achilles proceeded to answer him:
1.s86 “Son of Atreus, the man with the most glory, and most attached to possessions of all, how exactly will the Achaeans, great-hearted give you a prize?
1.s87 We do not  know of great common stores lying around anywhere at all.
1.s88 Rather, as we all know, the things which we sacked from the cities, these things have been handed out.
1.s89 and on the other hand it would also not be fitting for the soldiers to gather together again these clawed-back things things.
1.s90 Instead, you for your part now release this girl to the god.
1.s91 On our part, the Achaeans will repay you three times, and even four times, over, if Zeus at some point may confer the gift to sack completely the well-walled city Troy.
1.s92 And answering, the ruler Agamemnon addressed that man:
1.s93 “Do not  in this way- although being skillful, godlike Achilles- cheat with your mind, since you will not slip past nor persuade me.
1.s94 Do you really want- while you yourself are to hold onto your own prize- me, for my part, like this to sit still without having one?
1.s95 Are you telling me to give back this particular woman?
1.s96  Mind you, if the great-hearted Achaeans will give me a prize, having fashioned it exactly according to my heart, so that it will be worth just as much … (Agamemnon uses non-verbal communication -- perhaps a shrug of the shoulders -- to communicate that this would be acceptable)
1.s97 But, if they should not make a gift, then I myself, going in person would take possession for myself either your prize or that of Ajax, or that of Odysseus. Having taken position, I will lead it away.
1.s98 That man  will be angry and stay angry, whomever I would approach.
1.s99 That said,  certainly we will return to consider once again these things,
1.s100 Now, come. Let us drag a black ship into the divine sea.
1.s101 Let us gather within sufficient rowers.
1.s102 A sacrifice let us place inside.
1.s103 The beautiful-cheeked Chryseis herself we will embark.
1.s104 And let some single counsel-bearing man be the leader, either Ajax or Idomeneus or godlike Odysseus, or you, Son of Peleus, most outrageous of all men, unti, having performed sacrifices, you will appease him, the free-worker.
1.s105 Having given dark look  swift-footed Achilles addressed that man,
1.s106 “How dare you! You, all clothed in indecency, obsessed by profit, how would any of the Achaeans with determination listen to your words, either to go on a journey or with his own strength to fight with men?
1.s107 That is to be expected: I certainly did not come on account of Trojan spearmen here in order to fight, since they are not at fault to me in any way:
1.s108 for they did not ever drive away my cattle, nor  my horses, nor in warrior-nourishing, fertile Phthia did they ever harm the harvest, since there are many things between: many  shady mountains and also the roaring sea.
1.s109 Instead you, oh unbelievably indecent one, together we followed so that you might rejoice, seeking to gain respect for Menelaus and for you, dog-face, from the Trojans.
1.s110 Of these things you do not consider at all.
1.s111 Nor do you give a damn-
1.s112 And now you make make threats that you yourself to seize for yourself my prize, for which I struggled at length, and which the sons of the Achaeans gave to me.
1.s113 Certainly I never have a prize equal to yours, whenever the Achaeans sack and pillage a well-managed city of the Trojans.
1.s114 Instead, you may be sure, the greater part of the miserable fighting my hands perform;
1.s115 nevertheless whenever the division of spoils is at hand, for you the prize is much greater,
1.s116 while a smaller yet precious prize I for my part go on my way carrying upon the ships, after I am exhausted from waging war.
1.s117 But now I will go to Phthia, since it is surely much superior to go home with the curved ships.
1.s118 With me being disrespected here, I do not plan, to ladle out riches and wealth for you.
1.s119 And then the lord of men, Agamemnon, began to answer him:
1.s120 “By all means run away, if your heart is stirred in that direction.
1.s121  I, for one, certainly, do not plead with you to stay on account of me:
1.s122 beside me, you can be sure, are others as well who will respect me- - and most of all, Zeus, the giver of counsel.
1.s123 You are the most hateful  to me of the kings fostered by Zeus:
1.s124 for competing with others is always dear to you, as are both wars and battles.
1.s125 If you are very strong, at some point a god gave this  to you.
1.s126 Going home with both your own ships and with your own comrades, lord it over the Myrmidons.
1.s127  And as for me, I don’t give a damn about you,
1.s128 nor do I worry about you bearing a grudge.
1.s129 But I will make the following threat to you:
1.s130 as Phoebus Apollo is taking away for himself from me Chryseis, that woman, you can be sure, I will send on her way with both my own ship and my own comrades.
1.s131 For my part, however, I will lead beautiful-cheeked Briseis, that  prize of yours, going myself to your resting-place, so that you will clearly see how greatly I am superior to you, and another man as well will fear to declare himself an equal to me, and to treat himself as a peer to my face.
1.s132 So he spoke.
1.s133 And pain materialized in the son of Peleus.
1.s134 The heart in his hairy chest was torn in two directions: whether HE having drawn for himself the sharp sword from beside his thigh, would  make the men stand back while he for his part would kill the son of Atreus, or he could stop his anger and restrain his heart.
1.s135 As he was turning over these things through his thoughts and through his heart, he was beginning to pull for himself  from his sheath a great sword, but Athena came from heaven.
1.s136 The reason for this was that the white-armed goddess Hera sent her forth, both caring about and concerned for the two men equally in her heart.
1.s137 She stood  behind him,
1.s138 and by his light hair she gripped the son of Peleus, making herself visible to him alone.
1.s139 None of the others  could see.
1.s140 Achilles was astonished ,
1.s141 and turned himself around.
1.s142 And right then and there he recognized Pallas Athena.
1.s143 and her two eyes appeared terrifying.
1.s144  Having addressed her, he began to give voice to winged words:
1.s145 “There you are! Why, daughter of aegis-holding Zeus, have you come?
1.s146 Is it  so that you might see for yourself the outrageous behavior of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?
1.s147 Whatever the answer I will tell you something.
1.s148 And this as well I expect to be fulfilled:
1.s149 by his outrageous actions soon he will destroy his life.
1.s150 Then to him the goddess spoke, owl-eyed Athena:
1.s151 “I, for part, came in order to stop this rage of yours- - if you might obey- - down from the heavens.
1.s152 The white-armed goddess Hera sent me forth, both caring about and concerned for both equally in her heart.
1.s153 Instead, come on. Step away from this quarrel.
1.s154 Do not keep drawing for yourself the sword in your hand.
1.s155 Instead, by all means, with words as much as you please paint him a nasty picture of how he can be sure it will be:
1.s156 Because I will tell you how this is is.
1.s157 And as well this will in reality be fulfilled.
1.s158 In the future, there will be present in your possession three times as many shining gifts because of the outrageous behavior that we see here.
1.s159 As for you, hold yourself back.
1.s160 Listen to to us.
1.s161 And, replying, swift-footed Achilles said to her:
1.s162 “Of course, goddess, it is necessary to heed a statement from the two of you, at last , even though really filled up with anger in one’s heart.
1.s163 For it is better this way.
1.s164 Whoever obeys the gods, they really  listen to that man.
1.s165 He spoke.
1.s166 And on the silver hilt he held his heavy hand,
1.s167 Back into the sheath he shoved the great sword,
1.s168 and he did not disobey the command of Athena.
1.s169 But as for that goddess, she had already departed to Olympus, into the home of aegis-holding Zeus among the other divinities.
1.s170 The son of Peleus  yet again with harsh words spoke to the son of Atreus.
1.s171 And he was not yet stepping away from his anger;
1.s172 “Swollen with wine, having the eyes of a dog but the heart of a deer, never to arm yourself for battle together with the army, nor ever to enter an ambush  with the most outstanding of the Achaeans have you had the fortitude in your heart.
1.s173 That seems to you to be death.
1.s174 Surely it is much more preferable along the broad camp of the Achaeans to take away for yourself gifts from whoever may have speak against you.
1.s175 You are a king who devours his people, because you lord over nobodies!
1.s176 For truly, son of Atreus, you would now have acted abusively for the last time.
1.s177 Instead I will explain to you,
1.s178 and besides I will swear a great oath.
1.s179 Truly by this very staff, which never in truth will sprout leaves and branches, after  it first left behind its stump in the mountains, nor will it flourish again.
1.s180 For the bronze stripped it all around both the leaves and the bark.
1.s181 Now, however, the sons of the Achaeans, acting as judges, carry it in their palms, they who  defend the laws of the cosmos on behalf of Zeus.
1.s182 This  will be a great oath to you.
1.s183 In the future certainly a desire for Achilles will come upon the sons of the Achaeans each and every one of them!
1.s184 And then you, though stricken with pain, will not have the power to provide protection in the least, when many fall dying at the hands of Hector the man-slaughterer.
1.s185 You  will gouge open your own heart within, consumed with fury because you showed respect to in no way the best of the Achaeans.
1.s186 So spoke the son of Peleus.
1.s187 And he flung against the ground the staff, drilled with golden studs.
1.s188 And he himself began to sit.
1.s189 And the son of Atreus from the other side continued in wrath.
1.s190 And among them Nestor, pleasing in speech lept up, the articulate assembly-speaker of the Pylians, and from that man’s tongue speech began to flow, sweeter than honey.
1.s191 Already for him already two generations of mortal men had passed away, who previously along with him were raised and born in most holy Pylos.
1.s192 And now, he was lord among the third generation.
1.s193 He, thinking constructively for them, addressed the assembly and spoke in their midst:
1.s194 “I can’t believe it! For sure great sorrow has reached the Achaean land;
1.s195 You can be sure Priam would rejoice, as would the children of Priam, while the other Trojans would filled with pleasure greatly in their hearts, if they should hear about all these things here, about the two of you fighting, you who are above  the Danaans in planning, and above in fighting.
1.s196 Stop it! Listen to me!
1.s197 the two of you both  are younger than I am:
1.s198 For as for me, already at times, with men even better than you both, spent my time.
1.s199 And not once would those men, you may be sure dismiss me.
1.s200 Let me tell you, never have I seen, nor would I see with my own eyes, such men, such as Peirithous and Dryas, the shepherd of the soldiers, and Caeneus and Exadius and also godlike Polyphemus, and the son of Aegeus’ son, Theseus, a man like the immortals.
1.s201 those were brought up as the mightiest of the men on earth.
1.s202 Let me make this point clear: they were the mightiest.
1.s203 And they would fight against the mightiest- - against mountain-dwelling centaurs.
1.s204 And utterly they annihilated them.
1.s205 First, I used to spend my time among those men, having come from Pylos, from far away, from a distant land.
1.s206 Why did I come? Because  called for me.
1.s207 And I would fight on my own with my own two hands- I did that!
1.s208 And let me make this point clear as well, with those men (gesturing in the distance to emphasize the separation from the present)  no one of those who are now mortals on this earth could put up a fight.
1.s209 But you may be sure, they paid attention to my plans
1.s210 and they would listen to my recommendations.
1.s211 And so now, listen to me- - and I mean you (plural, addressing Agamemnon and Achilles both)! -- because to listen is better.
1.s212 As for you (singular, addressing Agamemnon), high-ranking though you are- do not take away for yourself the girl from this man here.
1.s213 Instead, leave it just as at first the sons of Achaeans gave the prize to him;
1.s214 And as for you, do not, son of Peleus, choose to compete with a king, pitting your strength against his, since a staff-holding king, to whom  Zeus gave renown never has received possession of a position of respect that is comparable.
1.s215 If  you are stronger, a goddess  as mother bore you, nevertheless he still is superior since he is lord over more people.
1.s216 Son of Atreus, as for you, stop your rage:
1.s217 look! I, for my part, I beg you to let go of your anger towards Achilles, he who to all the Achaeans is a great defense in cruel war.
1.s218 And, answering him, ruling Agamemnon spoke:
1.s219 “Sure enough,  you said all these things  rightly, old man.
1.s220 But this man here wishes to be above all others.
1.s221 Not only does he desire to be stronger than everyone, but also to be lord over everyone, and to give orders to everyone. As far as these things are concerned, I don’t expect anyone to listen.
1.s222 If  the gods, existing always, made him a spearman, for that reason do they allow him to publicly deliver insults?
1.s223 But then, interrupting, godlike Achilles began to answer him:
1.s224 “Surely  I would be called both a coward and a nobody, if  I will yield to you in each action, whatever you might say.
1.s225 To other men, for all I care, make these commands.
1.s226 Because, to me, you can be sure, don’t give any orders.
1.s227 In fact I, for my part, do not expect to listen to you in the future.
1.s228 And I will tell you another thing.
1.s229 You for your part,  deposit it into your heart:
1.s230 indeed I will not fight against  you with my hands on account of the girl- - not with you, not with any other man- - since you (pl), having given her, now take her away for yourselves from me .
1.s231 But as for the other things, which are in my possession beside the swift black ship, of these things you may not carry away anything, having picked it up with me unwilling.
1.s232 But come on- really, try for yourself, so that these men here as well may learn-
1.s233 your dark blood will pour out right then and there around my spear.
1.s234 Thus the two of them , having fought with such opposing speeches, they stood up,
1.s235 and they dismissed the assembly beside the ships of the Achaeans.
1.s236 The son of Peleus, on the one hand, went on his way towards the resting-places and the well-balanced ships with both the son of Menoetius and his comrades.
1.s237 Meanwhile, the son of Atreus  dragged forward a swift ship to the sea.
1.s238 And therein he selected twenty rowers.
1.s239 And a sacrifice for the god he embarked,
1.s240 and up into the ship he, leading, seated the beautiful-cheeked Chryseis.
1.s241 And in went as leader the adaptable Odysseus.
1.s242 Then they, or on their side, having embarked, began to sail over the watery routes,
1.s243 while the son of Atreus commanded the soldiers to purify themselves.
1.s244 Those  began purifying themselves.
1.s245 And they flinging the impurities into the sea.
1.s246 Then they began to perform potent sacrifices for Apollo, of bulls and of goats, along the shore of the barren sea:
1.s247 and the aroma reached the heavens, swirling about in the smoke.
1.s248 In this way they  began working on these things down throughout the camp.
1.s249 But, Agamemnon was not stepping away from the competition which he first threatened against Achilles,
1.s250 Instead he  spoke to both Talthybius and Eurybates, those two who were his heralds and ready attendants:
1.s251 “You two go to the resting-place of Peleus’ son, Achilles.
1.s252 After seizing beautiful-cheeked Briseis by the hand, bring her.
1.s253 If  he should not give her, then I myself person would seize her for myself, having come with an more men.
1.s254 And for him that will be more to be feared.
1.s255 Having spoken thus, he sent them forth.
1.s256 He imposed the cruel command.
1.s257 the two, unwilling,  both walked along the shore of the barren sea,
1.s258 The two of them arrived at both the resting-places and the ships of the Myrmidons.
1.s259 That man they found beside both his resting-place and his black ship, sitting.
1.s260 Nor did Achilles rejoice at all having caught sight of those two.
1.s261 On the one hand, the two men, terrified at, and feeling shame before, the king, stood there.
1.s262 but They did not begin to address
1.s263 him about anything nor did they ask any questions.
1.s264 For his part that man understood the situation in his heart
1.s265 and spoke:
1.s266 “Welcome, heralds, messengers of Zeus and also of men,
1.s267 Come closer.
1.s268 Don’t worry, you are not to be responsible to me for anything: instead Agamemnon is, the one who sent you two forth on account of the girl Briseis.(
1.s269 Achilles turns to Patroclus) Come, Zeus-born Patroclus, bring out the girl
1.s270 and give her to these two to lead away.
1.s271 And let these two themselves be witnesses both before the blessed gods and before mortal people, and before that unfeeling king, if some day  again need of me should arise to defend against shameful destruction for those others.
1.s272 For surely he is out of control, with a self-destructive heart,
1.s273  He does not at all understand how to plan for the future and the past together so that the Achaeans might in the future fight besides the ships, safe under his watch.
1.s274 So he spoke,
1.s275 and Patroclus began to obey his beloved companion;
1.s276  he led the beautiful-cheeked Bryseis out of the resting-place,
1.s277 and he gave her to lead away.
1.s278 The two of them  went back along the ships of the Achaeans,
1.s279 and that person, the woman, unwilling, started on her way along with those people.
1.s280 As for Achilles, having started to cry, he at once took a seat far away from his companions, sinking down upon the shore of the gray saltwater and gazing out upon the boundless sea.
1.s281 And he  at length as god-talker spoke to to his beloved mother, stretching out his hands:
1.s282 “Mother, since you did after all give birth to me, although being destined for a short life, a position commanding appropriate respect, at the very least, the Olympian ought to extend to me- Zeus thundering on high.
1.s283 But now not even a little did he show respect to me.
1.s284 That is clearly the case because, in truth, the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, has shown disrespect to me.
1.s285 For, having snatched my prize, he holds it- - he himself having stolen it.
1.s286 So he spoke, shedding tears.
1.s287 That man his revered mother heard, sitting in the depths of the sea beside her father, an old man.
1.s288 Swiftly  she rose up from the gray sea like the mist,
1.s289 and  before that man, with him shedding tears, she sat down With her hand she caressed him and she also spoke, and began speaking to him by name:
1.s289a "Son, why are you crying?
1.s290 What  sorrow reached your heart?
1.s291 Speak out- - do not conceal it in your mind! -- so that we both might know.
1.s292 Groaning deeply, he answered her , the swift-footed Achilles:
1.s293 “You know-
1.s294 why then should I list all these things to you, who already know?
1.s295 We made our way into Thebes, the sacred city of Eetion.
1.s296 That city we sacked from one end to the other, and we also led everything here.
1.s297 And while these things the sons of the Achaeans divided up well among themselves:
1.s298 And they took out the beautiful-cheeked daughter of Chryses for the son of Atreus.
1.s299 But then Chryses, the sacrifice-leader of the far-shooter Apollo, came to the swift ships of the bronze-wearing Achaeans in order to free  his daughter, bearing  boundless ransom, holding the wreaths of the far-shooter Apollo in his hands aloft on his golden staff.
1.s300 And he began to plead with all the Achaeans, and especially with the two sons of Atreus, the organizers of the soldiers.
1.s301 At that point indeed all the other Achaeans responded approvingly, both to treat with decency the sacrifice-leader and to accept the shining ransom.
1.s302 However, this was not sweet to the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, in his heart.
1.s303 Instead, he dismissed him cruelly.
1.s304  He began to impose upon him a harsh command.
1.s305  The old man, seething with anger, made his way back.
1.s306 and to him, after he had begun his prayer, Apollo listened, because Chryses was very dear to him.
1.s307 And he fired an evil arrow against the Argives.
1.s308 Now those soldiers, one after another, kept dying.
1.s309 And those arrows of the god kept flying in on every side up through the wide camp of the Achaeans.
1.s310 To us  the prophet, thinking benevolently, began to publicly deliver the prophecies of the far-shooter.
1.s311 Immediately I was the one who first began to urge that we should appease the god.
1.s312 But then anger took hold of the son of Atreus,
1.s313 Instantly after standing up he gave a threatening command, which  has been brought to completion.
1.s314 Here is what I mean: that woman, to begin with, the quick-eyed Achaeans with a swift ship send to Chryses,
1.s315 At the same time, they bring gifts for the lord.
1.s316 But this other woman just now the heralds went on their way, leading her away from my resting-place- - the daughter of Briseus, the woman whom the sons of the Achaeans gave to me.
1.s317 But if you really have the power, protect your noble son.
1.s318 Having gone to Olympus, plead with Zeus, if at any time  in any way either by what you have said or in fact by what you have done you cheered the heart of Zeus.
1.s319 For often in the great rooms of your father I have heard you boasting, when you stated that for black-clouded son of Cronos you alone among the immortals fought off shameful destruction, when the other Olympians wished to tie him up, both Hera and Poseidon and even Pallas Athena.
1.s320 But you, goddess, having come, released that one from his chains, having immediately called the hundred-handed one into great Olympus, he whom the gods call Briareus, and all men Aegaeon.
1.s321 For that one, in turn, is better than his father in terms of physical strength.
1.s322 He then sat down beside the son of Cronos, basking in his aura of power.
1.s323 And before him they cowered the blessed gods.
1.s324 So they did not still tie him up.
1.s325 Now, having reminded him of these things, sit at his side and take hold of his knees, if somehow he might be willing to bring aid upon the Trojans, and to squeeze together the Achaeans both down among their ships’ decks, and around the sea, as they are killed, so that all may enjoy the full benefit of their king; and the son of Atreus, widely-ruling Agamemnon, also may recognize his own self-destructive stupidity, in that he showed no respect to the best of the Achaeans.
1.s326 And Thetis, pouring down tears, then began to answer him:
1.s327 “(sighing deeply) My son, why did I take the time to raise you- I, after bearing you for awful things?
1.s328 I wish you might be able, beside the ships, without tears and without suffering, to remain quietly! since, even now, the fate assigned to you is brief as it is, is not very long at all.
1.s329 But now, you are, simultaneously, both doomed to die soon and unhappy beyond all people
1.s330 So it was for an evil destiny that I gave birth to you in the great rooms.
1.s331 To present this  statement for you to Zeus, who delights in thunderbolt, I, in person, will go to snow-covered Olympus in the hopes that he may be persuaded.
1.s332 But as for you, now sitting beside the swift-sailing ships, continue in wrath against the Achaeans.
1.s333 Put a stop to your actions away from war completely.
1.s334 For Zeus yesterday went into Oceanus to the midst of the blameless Ethiopians, on account of a feast
1.s335 All the gods began to follow along.
1.s336 But on the twelfth day he will come back again to Olympus.
1.s337 And at that time, then on your behalf I will go to the bronze-floored house of Zeus,
1.s338 and I will clasp him by his knees.
1.s339 And I expect to make my case successfully to him.
1.s340 Having spoken thus  she went away.
1.s341 That one  she left then and there, filled with anger throughout his heart because of the well-girdled woman, she whom  they were stealing by force with him being unwilling.
1.s342 As for Odysseus, he was on his way to Chrysa, bringing a sacred sacrifice.
1.s343 When they   entered within the very deep harbor first they took in their sails, then they placed them in the black ship.
1.s344 Then they guided the mast to the mast-holder having lowered it with ropes quickly.
1.s345 With oars they rowed it forward into the anchoring-area.
1.s346 And out they cast the anchors.
1.s347 They tied down the boat’s stern-cables;
1.s348 As for the men themselves they made their way out at the edge of the sea.
1.s349 They disembarked the sacrifice for the far-shooter Apollo;
1.s350 And out of the sea-faring ship Chryseis walked.
1.s351 And then at that point Odysseus, a man of many counsels, leading her up to the altar, put her in her beloved father’s hands.
1.s352 And he spoke to him:
1.s353 “ Chryses, the lord of men sent me forth, Agamemnon, both to lead your child to you and to perform a sacred sacrifice for Phoebus on behalf of the Danaans, so that we may appease the lord, he who now has set in motion grievous troubles to the Argives.
1.s354 Having spoken in this way, he placed her in his hands.
1.s354a And that man, rejoicing, received his beloved daughter.
1.s355 Quickly the sacred sacrifice for the  god they made stand in a row about the well-built altar.
1.s356 Then they purified their hands with water and picked up in their hands ground barley.
1.s357 Then among them Chryses, having raised his hands, began to pray loudly:
1.s358 “Listen to me, silver-bowed one, you who encircled Chrysa and sacred Cilla, and are lord of Tenedos by force.
1.s359 Just as certainly  once before you listened to me when I had prayed,
1.s360 and just as certainly you conferred respect upon me, at you also greatly harmed the soldiers of the Achaeans.
1.s361 And still even now, for me fulfill in addition the following wish:
1.s362 Right this minute, now, drive way shameful destruction from the Danaans.
1.s363 So he spoke, praying,
1.s364 and Phoebus Apollo listened to him.
1.s365 But then after they prayed and cast forth the ground barley, they first pulled back  the heads of the offerings, and then slaughtered and flayed them. They cut away the thighs  and wrapped up and down them in fat, having made it double-folded.
1.s366 Then they placed raw meat on top of the thigh pieces themselves.
1.s367 The old man began to burn them on skewers.
1.s368 Then he began to pour flashing wine on.
1.s369 The young men  next to him were holding five-pronged forks in their hands.
1.s370 After a while when the thigh pieces were burned thoroughly and they tasted the organs, they began to cut up  the rest and also pierced them with spits through both sides; they skillfully roasted  them, and pulled off for themselves everything.
1.s371 After a while, when they stopped themselves from work and prepared for themselves the feast, they kept sharing the feast, nor was their heart lacking in any way from the evenly-divided feast.
1.s372 After a while, when they rid themselves of the desire for drink and for food, the young men first for themselves they filled to the brim mixing-bowls with drink, then they distributed  this to everyone, having made the initial libations with the drinking-cups.
1.s373 Those men  throughout the entire day continued to appease the god through song and dance, the elite young men of the Achaeans singing the beautiful song to Apollo, celebrating with song the far-shooter.
1.s374 And that one, listening, was pleased in his heart.
1.s375 And when the sun sank and dusk arrived, then  they lay themselves down to sleep beside the stern-cables of the ship.
1.s376 And when early-born, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, right at that time then they began bringing themselves back to the midst of the broad camp of the Achaeans.
1.s377 For them  the far-shooter Apollo set in motion a favorable wind.
1.s378 And as for those men, they stood up for themselves the mast and spread high and wide the white sails.
1.s379 Wind swelled the sail in its center.
1.s380 And on both sides a wave, surging, was splashing against the front of the ship, as it travelled.
1.s381 And that ship, making time through its path, kept running over the wave.
1.s382 And then, after  they arrived at the broad camp of the Achaeans, first they pulled the black ship onto land, far up upon the sandy shore, and then they laid out the long supports underneath.
1.s383 Then the men themselves began to scatter throughout both the resting-places and
1.s384 Meanwhile that man remained filled with wrath, sitting alongside his swift-sailing ships- - the descendent of Zeus, son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles:
1.s385 Neither did he ever resume his habit of entering into the assembly that brings glory to men, nor into war.
1.s386 Instead he kept wearing and wearing away his beloved heart, remaining right where he was.
1.s387 He kept longing and longing for both the battle-shout and war.
1.s388 However   from that point, when the twelfth dawn took place then   the gods, existing always, went to Olympus, all of them at the same time.
1.s389 Zeus was leading the way.
1.s390 Thetis  was not forgetful of the demands of her own son-
1.s391 Far from it: that woman rose up over a wave of the sea.
1.s392 In the early morning  she went up to great heaven and Olympus.
1.s393 She found  the far-seeing son of Cronos sitting apart from the others, on the highest summit of many-peaked Olympus.
1.s394 And so then she sat down before Zeus himself,
1.s395 and she laid hold of his knees with her left hand,
1.s396 and  with her right hand she gripped beneath his chin, pleading with him, she addressed the lord Zeus, son of Cronos:
1.s397 “Father Zeus, if at any time  I among the immortals helped you, either by word or by deed, fulfill this wish for me:
1.s398 treat my son with proper respect, he who was doomed to the most swift death of others.
1.s399 Instead, now  the lord of men Agamemnon has shown disrespect to him.
1.s400 For he, having snatched his prize, holds it- - he himself having stolen it.
1.s401 Instead you for your part, I beg you, show proper respect for him, all-wise Olympian Zeus:
1.s402 so long  place in the possession the Trojans superior strength, until the Achaeans show proper respect to my son and glorify him with a position of respect.
1.s403 So she spoke,
1.s404 and he did not address her at all, Zeus the cloud-summoner.
1.s405 Rather, in silence he remained motionless for a long time.
1.s406 And as Thetis took hold for herself his knees, in this way she kept holding herself on, having attached herself on him.
1.s407 And again a second time she began to petition him:
1.s408 “Promise most faithfully to me, and nod your head in approval, or refuse, since for you fear does not exist, so that I may know well how greatly I am the most disrespected goddess among all.
1.s409 That woman , he answered, greatly agitated, , Zeus the cloud-summoner:
1.s410 “Without a doubt  these deeds are destructive, since you will push me to stir up a fight with Hera, when she would torment me with insulting words.
1.s411 And  to be sure in the same manner, among the immortal gods, with me always she picks fights.
1.s412 And she even claims that I support the Trojans in battle.
1.s413 But as for you, first, go back now, lest she should become aware of anything, Hera.
1.s414 Then these things will be an an object of concern for me until I am completely finished with it.
1.s415 But come- I will nod my approval to you with my head so that you may have settled confidence.
1.s416 As you know, this from me is truly the greatest sign among the immortals.
1.s417 for mine is not to be taken back, nor something that can deceive, nor can it go unfulfilled- - whatever I may nod my approval to with my head.
1.s418 He spoke,
1.s419 And with his dark brows, he gave the nod of approval, the son of Cronos.
1.s420 And  his divine hair flowed down from the lord’s immortal head.
1.s421 And he shook great Olympus.
1.s422 Then the two, having planned together in this way, separated.
1.s423 Then, she, for her part, lept from glittering Olympus into the deep sea, while Zeus went to his own home.
1.s424 All the gods stood up at the same time from their seats in front of their father;
1.s425 not one of them had the nerve to stay in their place as he was approaching.
1.s426 Instead facing him in greeting, they stood- - each and every one of them.
1.s427 So there indeed he sat down on his throne.
1.s428 But Hera, when she had seen him, did not fail to understand that she had fashioned plans together with him, silver-footed Thetis, the daughter of the old man of the sea.
1.s429 Right then and there with cutting words she began to address Zeus, the son of Cronos:
1.s430 “Who  of the gods fashioned plans together with you, devious one, this time?
1.s431 It is always dear to you being far away from me, thinking secret things to pass judgment on.
1.s432 To me have you not yet with determination brought yourself to give expression to whatever you may have in mind.
1.s433  Then he began to answer her, the father of both men and of gods:
1.s434 “Hera, do not  expect to know all my decisions:
1.s435 they will be too difficult for you, despite being my wife.
1.s436 This is how it is. Of course, whatever  is fitting to hear, then not anyone, neither any of the gods nor of humans will know that decision before you.
1.s437 But, that said, whatever decision I, for my part, might choose to think through separately from the gods, Do not in any way as for, you, for your part- do not in any way pose questions about or inquire after each and every one of these things.
1.s438 Then  she began to answer him, the ox-eyed, revered Hera:
1.s439 “You are the worst, son of Cronos, what sort of command was that which you said?
1.s440  Up until now indeed I neither question you constantly, nor do I make inquiries.
1.s441 But you, very much at-ease, plan these things however you should choose.
1.s442 And now I am filled with fear horribly down through my heart, that she may have convinced you, silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea.
1.s443 For in the early morning she seated herself beside you
1.s444 and took hold of your knees.
1.s445 To her, I think that you actually nodded in approval so that you would show respect to Achilles, and you would destroy many of the Achaeans beside the ships.
1.s446 Answering,  cloud-summoner Zeus addressed her:
1.s447 “You are out of your mind! You always  are calculating.
1.s448 And never do I slip past you.
1.s449 All the same,  you will not be able to accomplish anything.
1.s450 Instead from my heart you will be much more distant.
1.s451 And this will be even more to be feared by you.
1.s452 If  this is like this, it is going to be pleasing to me.
1.s453 Instead, sit in silence!
1.s454 Obey my command, or else however many gods that are in Olympus now would not protect you from me, coming close, when I would set invincible hands in motion against you.
1.s455 So he spoke.
1.s456 And she became frightened, the ox-eyed, revered Hera.
1.s457 So in silence she sat down, clamping down on her beloved heart.
1.s458 Throughout the house of Zeus the heavenly gods were made upset.
1.s459 Among them  Hephaestus, celebrated for his ability to make things, began to speak to the group conveying pleasing things to his beloved mother, white-armed Hera:
1.s460 “Without a doubt  these deeds will be destructive, and they will not be tolerable any longer if  you two quarrel in this way because of mortals and stir up a brawl among the gods.
1.s461 Nor will there be any enjoyment of this good feast, since the worse win.
1.s462 To my mother I for my part give this advice , even though she can think for herself: to convey pleasing things to my beloved father Zeus, so that my father would not fight again and disturb the feast along with us.
1.s463 For there is indeed the possibility that the Olympian of lightning would choose to shove us out of our seats.
1.s464 That one, as we all know, is the one who can generate the most force by far.
1.s465 Instead, you on your end, addressing that man with soft words.
1.s466 Immediately then the Olympian will be gracious to us.
1.s467 He spoke  thus.
1.s468 And, having lept up, he placed a two-handled cup in his dear mother’s hand.
1.s469 And he spoke to her:
1.s470 “Be strong, my mother.
1.s471 And hold yourself up, although being troubled, lest I may see in my eyes you, beloved as you are, being beaten.
1.s472 And then I will not be able, though stricken with pain, to offer protection in any way.
1.s473 As you know, the Olympian is very hard to set oneself against.
1.s474 For before now, also at another time as I was attempting to defend you, he flung me, having seized my foot, down from the divine threshold.
1.s475 Throughout the entire day I was propelled.
1.s476 Along with  the setting sun I ended my downward fall on Lemnos.
1.s477 But still a little spirit was still present within.
1.s478 There the Sintian men straight away took care of me, after having fallen.
1.s479 So he spoke.
1.s480 And white-armed goddess Hera smiled.
1.s481 And, after having smiled, she accepted from her child the cup in her hand.
1.s482 As for him, that one, starting from the left and moving to the right, for all the other gods began to pour out wine, drawing sweet nectar out of the mixing-bowl;
1.s483 Laughter too loud to be drowned out  then was stirred up among the blessed gods, as they saw Hephaestus bustling through the house.
1.s484 Then in this manner all day, until the sun had set, they kept sharing the feast.
1.s485 Neither was their heart lacking anything of the equally-divided feast, nor indeed of the outstandingly beautiful lyre, which Apollo was holding, nor of the Muses, who were singing, taking turns, with a beautiful voice.
1.s486 And then, after the shining light of the sun sank down, the rest of them  each went to their home in order to lie down, where for each the widely-renowned and crippled in both feet Hephaestus made a house, with his knowing mind.
1.s487 And Olympian Zeus, god of lightning, made his way to his bed.
1.s488 There formerly he used to rest himself when sweet sleep might come to him.
1.s489 There, having ascended, he lay down to sleep.
1.s490 And at his side was golden-throned Hera.
