    "0":"The extent and military force of the Roman empire, in the age of the AntoninesIntroduction\n IN the second century of the Christian era, the Empire of\n Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the\n most civilised portion of mankind. The frontiers of that\n extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and\n disciplined valour. The gentle but powerful influence of\n laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the\n provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the\n advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free\n constitution was preserved with decent reverence: the Roman\n senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and\n devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of\n government. During a happy period (A.D. 98-180) of more than\n fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by\n the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the\n two Antonines. It is the design of this, and of the two\n succeeding chapters, to describe the prosperous condition of\n their empire; and afterwards, from the death of Marcus\n Antoninus, to deduce the most important circumstances of its\n decline and fall; a revolution which will ever be\n remembered, and is still felt by the nations of the earth.\n \nModeration of Augustus\n The principal conquests of the Romans were achieved under\n the republic; and the emperors, for the most part, were\n satisfied with preserving those dominions which had been\n acquired by the policy of the senate, the active emulation\n of the consuls, and the martial enthusiasm of the people.\n The seven first centuries were filled with a rapid\n succession of triumphs; but it was reserved for Augustus to\n relinquish the ambitious design of subduing the whole earth,\n and to introduce a spirit of moderation into the public\n councils. Inclined to peace by his temper and situation, it\n was easy for him to discover that Rome, in her present\n exalted situation, had much less to hope than to fear from\n the chance of arms; and that, in the prosecution of remote\n wars, the undertaking became every day more difficult, the\n event more doubtful, and the possession more precarious, and\n less beneficial. The experience of Augustus added weight to\n these salutary reflections, and effectually convinced him\n that, by the prudent vigour of his counsels, it would be\n easy to secure every concession which the safety or the\n dignity of Rome might require from the most formidable\n Barbarians. Instead of exposing his person and his legions\n to the arrows of the Parthians, he obtained, by an\n honourable treaty, the restitution of the standards and\n prisoners which had been taken in the defeat of Crassus. (1) \n \n His generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted the\n reduction of Ethiopia and Arabia Felix. They marched near a\n thousand miles to the south of the tropic; but the heat of\n the climate soon repelled the invaders, and protected the\n unwarlike natives of those sequestered regions. (2) The\n northern countries of Europe scarcely deserved the expense\n and labour of conquest. The forests and morasses of Germany\n were filled with a hardy race of barbarians, who despised\n life when it was separated from freedom; and though, on the\n first attack, they seemed to yield to the weight of the\n Roman power, they soon, by a signal act of despair, regained\n their independence, and reminded Augustus of the vicissitude\n of fortune. (3) On the death of that emperor, his testament was publicly read in the senate. He bequeathed, as a valuable legacy to his successors, the advice of confining\n the empire within those limits, which Nature seemed to have\n placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries; on the west\n the Atlantic ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the north; the\n Euphrates on the east; and towards the south, the sandy\n deserts of Arabia and Africa. (4)\n \nImitated by his successors\n Happily for the repose of mankind, the moderate system\n recommended by the wisdom of Augustus, was adopted by the\n fears and vices of his immediate successors. Engaged in the\n pursuit of pleasure, or in the exercise of tyranny, the\n first Caesars seldom showed themselves to the armies, or to\n the provinces; nor were they disposed to suffer, that those\n triumphs which their indolence neglected should be usurped\n by the conduct and valour of their lieutenants. The military\n frame of a subject was considered as an insolent invasion of\n the Imperial prerogative; and it became the duty, as well as\n interest, of every Roman general, to guard the frontiers\n intrusted to his care, without aspiring to conquests which\n might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the\n vanquished barbarians. (5) \n \nConquest of Britian was the first exception to it\n The only accession which the Roman empire received, during\n the first century of the Christian era, was the province of\n Britain. In this single instance the successors of Caesar\n and Augustus were persuaded to follow the example of the\n former, rather than the precept of the latter. The proximity\n of its situation to the coast of Gaul seemed to invite their\n arms; the pleasing, though doubtful intelligence, of a pearl\n fishery, attracted their avarice; (6) and as Britain was\n viewed in the light of a distinct and insulated world, the\n conquest scarcely formed any exception to the general system\n of continental measures. After a war of about forty years,\n undertaken by the most stupid, maintained by the most\n dissolute, and terminated by the most timid of all the\n emperors, the far greater part of the island submitted to\n the Roman yoke. (7) The various tribes of Britons possessed valour without conduct, and the love of freedom without the spirit of union. They took up arms with savage fierceness;\n they laid them down, or turned them against each other with\n wild inconstancy; and while they fought singly, they were\n successively subdued. Neither the fortitude of Caractacus,\n nor the despair of Boadicea, nor the fanaticism of the\n Druids, could avert the slavery of their country, or resist\n the steady progress of the Imperial generals, who maintained\n the national glory, when the throne was disgraced by the\n weakest, or the most vicious of mankind. At the very time\n when Domitian, confined to his palace, felt the terrors\n which he inspired; his legions, under the command of the\n virtuous Agricola, defeated the collected force of the\n Caledonians at the foot of the Grampian hills; and his\n fleets, venturing to explore an unknown and dangerous\n navigation, displayed the Roman arms round every part of the\n island. The conquest of Britain was considered as already\n achieved; (8) and it was the design of Agricola to complete\n and ensure his success by the easy reduction of Ireland, for\n which in his opinion, one legion and a few auxiliaries were\n sufficient. (9) The western isle might be improved into a\n valuable possession, and the Britons would wear their chains\n with the less reluctance, if the prospect and example of\n freedom were on every side removed from before their eyes.\n \n But the superior merit of Agricola soon occasioned his\n removal from the government of Britain; and for ever\n disappointed this rational, though extensive scheme of\n conquest. Before his departure, the prudent general had\n provided for security as well as for dominion. He had\n observed that the island is almost divided into two unequal\n parts by the opposite gulfs, or, as they are now called, the\n Firths of Scotland. Across the narrow interval of about\n forty miles, he had drawn a line of military stations, which\n was afterwards fortified in the reign of Antoninus Pius, by\n a turf rampart erected on foundations of stone. (10) This\n wall of Antoninus, at a small distance beyond the modern\n cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, was fixed as the limit of\n the Roman province. The native Caledonians preserved in the\n northern extremity of the island their wild independence,\n for which they were not less indebted to their poverty than\n to their valour. Their incursions were frequently repelled\n and chastised; but their country was never subdued. (11) The\n masters of the fairest and most wealthy climates of the\n globe turned with contempt from gloomy hills assailed by the\n winter tempest, from lakes concealed in a blue mist, and\n from cold and lonely heaths, over which the deer of the\n forest were chased by a troop of naked barbarians. (12) \n \nConquest of Dacia; the second exception\n Such was the state of the Roman frontiers, and such the\n maxims of Imperial policy, from the death of Augustus to the\n accession of Trajan. That virtuous and active prince had\n received the education of a soldier, and possessed the\n talents of a general. (13) The peaceful system of his predecessors was interrupted by scenes of war and conquest; and the legions, after a long interval, beheld a military\n emperor at their head. The first exploits of Trajan were\n against the Dacians, the most warlike of men, who dwelt\n beyond the Danube, and who, during the reign of Domitian,\n had insulted with impunity the Majesty of Rome. (14) To the\n strength and fierceness of barbarians, they added a contempt\n for life, which was derived from a warm persuasion of the\n immortality and transmigration of the soul. (15) Decebalus,\n the Dacian king, approved himself a rival not unworthy of\n Trajan; nor did he despair of his own and the public\n fortune, till, by the confession of his enemies, he had\n exhausted every resource both of valour and policy. (16) \n This memorable war, with a very short suspension of\n hostilities, lasted five years; and as the emperor could\n exert, without control, the whole force of the state, it was\n terminated by an absolute submission of the barbarians. (17) \n The new province of Dacia, which formed a second exception\n to the precept of Augustus, was about 1300 miles in\n circumference. Its natural boundaries were the Dniester, the\n Teyss [Theiss modern form], or Tibiscus, the Lower Danube,\n and the Euxine Sea. The vestiges of a military road may\n still be traced from the banks of the Danube to the\n neighbourhood of Bender, a place famous in modern history,\n and the actual frontier of the Turkish and Russian empires.\n (18) \n \nConquest of Trajan in the east\n Trajan was ambitious of fame; and as long as mankind shall\n continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers\n than on their benefactors, the thirst of military glory will\n ever be the vice of the most exalted characters. The praises\n of Alexander, transmitted by a succession of poets and\n historians, had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of\n Trajan. Like him the Roman emperor undertook an expedition\n against the nations of the east, but he lamented with a\n sigh, that his advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of\n equalling the renown of the son of Philip. (19) Yet the\n success of Trajan, however transient, was rapid and\n specious. The degenerate Parthians, broken by intestine\n discord, fled before his arms. He descended the river Tigris\n in triumph, from the mountains of Armenia to the Persian\n gulf. He enjoyed the honour of being the first, as he was\n the last, of the Roman generals, who ever navigated that\n remote sea. His fleets ravaged the coasts of Arabia; and\n Trajan vainly flattered himself that he was approaching\n towards the confines of India. (20) Every day the astonished\n senate received the intelligence of new names and new\n nations, that acknowledged his sway. They were informed that\n the kings of Bosphorus, Colchos, Iberia, Albania, Osrhoene,\n and even the Parthian monarch himself, had accepted their\n diadems from the hands of the emperor; that the independent\n tribes of the Median and Carduchian hills had implored his\n protection; and that the rich countries of Armenia,\n Mesopotamia, and Assyria, were reduced into the state of\n provinces. (21) But the death of Trajan soon clouded the\n splendid prospect; and it was justly to be dreaded that so\n many distant nations would throw off the unaccustomed yoke,\n when they were no longer restrained by the powerful hand\n which had imposed it.\n \nResigned by his successor Hadrian\n It was an ancient tradition, that when the Capitol was\n founded by one of the Roman kings, the god Terminus (who\n presided over boundaries, and was represented according to\n the fashion of that age by a large stone) alone, among all\n the inferior deities, refused to yield his place to Jupiter\n himself. A favourable inference was drawn from his\n obstinacy, which was interpreted by the augurs as a sure\n presage that the boundaries of the Roman power would never\n recede. (22) During many ages, the prediction, as it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment. But though Terminus had resisted the majesty of Jupiter, he submitted\n to the authority of the emperor Hadrian. (23) The\n resignation of all the eastern conquests of Trajan was the\n first measure of his reign. He restored to the Parthians the\n election of an independent sovereign, withdrew the Roman\n garrisons from the provinces of Armenia, Mesopotamia, and\n Assyria, and, in compliance with the precept of Augustus,\n once more established the Euphrates as the frontier of the\n empire. (24) Censure, which arraigns the public actions and\n the private motives of princes, has ascribed to envy, a\n conduct, which might be attributed to the prudence and\n moderation of Hadrian. The various character of that\n emperor, capable, by turns, of the meanest and the most\n generous sentiments, may afford some colour to the\n suspicion: It was, however, scarcely in his power to place\n the superiority of his predecessor in a more conspicuous\n light, than by thus confessing himself unequal to the task\n of defending the conquests of Trajan.\n \nContrast of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius\n The martial and ambitious spirit of Trajan formed a very\n singular contrast with the moderation of his successor. The\n restless activity of Hadrian was not less remarkable, when\n compared with the gentle repose of Antoninus Pius. The life\n of the former was almost a perpetual journey; and as he\n possessed the various talents of the soldier, the statesman,\n and the scholar, he gratified his curiosity in the discharge\n of his duty. Careless of the difference of seasons and of\n climates, he marched on foot, and bare-headed, over the\n snows of Caledonia, and the sultry plains of the Upper\n Egypt; nor was there a province of the empire which, in the\n course of his reign, was not honoured with the presence of\n the monarch. (25) But the tranquil life of Antoninus Pius\n was spent in the bosom of Italy; and, during the\n twenty-three years that he directed public administration,\n the longest journeys of that amiable prince extended no\n farther than from his palace in Rome to the retirement of\n his Lanuvian Villa. (26) \n \nPacific system of Hadrian and the two Antonines\n Notwithstanding this difference in their personal conduct,\n the general system of Augustus was equally adopted and\n uniformly pursued by Hadrian and by the two Antonines. They\n persisted in the design of maintaining the dignity of the\n empire, without attempting to enlarge its limits. By every\n honourable expedient they invited the friendship of the\n barbarians; and endeavoured to convince mankind that the\n Roman power, raised above the temptation of conquest, was\n actuated only by the love of order and justice. During a\n long period of forty-three years their virtuous labours were\n crowned with success; and if we except a few slight\n hostilities that served to exercise the legions of the\n frontier, the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius offer the\n fair prospect of universal peace. (27) The Roman name was\n revered among the most remote nations of the earth. The\n fiercest barbarians frequently submitted their differences\n to the arbitration of the emperor; and we are informed by a\n contemporary historian, that he had seen ambassadors who\n were refused the honour which they came to solicit, of being\n admitted into the rank of subjects. (28) \n \nDefensive wars of Marcus Antoninus\n The terror of the Roman arms added weight and dignity to the\n moderation of the emperors. They preserved peace by a\n constant preparation for war; and while justice regulated\n their conduct, they announced to the nations on their\n confines that they were as little disposed to endure as to\n offer an injury. The military strength, which it had been\n sufficient for Hadrian and the elder Antoninus to display,\n was exerted against the Parthians and the Germans by the\n emperor Marcus. The hostilities of the barbarians provoked\n the resentment of that philosophic monarch, and, in the\n prosecution of a just defence, Marcus and his generals\n obtained many signal victories, both on the Euphrates and on\n the Danube. (29) The military establishment of the Roman\n empire, which thus assured either its tranquillity or\n success, will now become the proper and important object of\n our attention.\n \nMilitary establishment of the Roman Emperors\n In the purer ages of the commonwealth, the use of arms was\n reserved for those ranks of citizens who had a country to\n love, a property to defend, and some share in enacting those\n laws, which it was their interest, as well as duty, to\n maintain. But in proportion as the public freedom was lost\n in extent of conquest, war was gradually improved into an\n art, and degraded into a trade. (30) The legions themselves,\n even at the time when they were recruited in the most\n distant provinces, were supposed to consist of Roman\n citizens. That distinction was generally considered either\n as a legal qualification or as a proper recompense for the\n soldier; but a more serious regard was paid to the essential\n merit of age, strength, and military stature. (31) In all\n levies, a just preference was given to the climates of the\n North over those of the South: the race of men born to the\n exercise of arms was sought for in the country rather than\n in cities; and it was very reasonably presumed, that the\n hardy occupations of smiths, carpenters, and huntsmen, would\n supply more vigour and resolution than the sedentary trades\n which are employed in the service of luxury. (32) After\n every qualification of property had been laid aside, the\n armies of the Roman emperors were still commanded, for the\n most part, by officers of a liberal birth and education, but\n the common soldiers, like the mercenary troops of modern\n Europe, were drawn from the meanest, and very frequently\n from the most profligate, of mankind.\n \nDiscipline\n That public virtue which among the ancients was denominated\n patriotism, is derived from a strong sense of our own\n interest in the preservation and prosperity of the free\n government of which we are members. Such a sentiment, which\n had rendered the legions of the republic almost invincible,\n could make but a very feeble impression on the mercenary\n servants of a despotic prince; and it became necessary to\n supply that defect by other motives, of a different, but not\n less forcible nature; honour and religion. The peasant, or\n mechanic, imbibed the useful prejudice that he was advanced\n to the more dignified profession of arms, in which his rank\n and reputation would depend on his own valour; and that,\n although the prowess of a private soldier must often escape\n the notice of fame, his own behaviour might sometimes confer\n glory or disgrace on the company, the legion, or even the\n army, to whose honours he was associated. On his first\n entrance into the service, an oath was administered to him,\n with every circumstance of solemnity. He promised never to\n desert his standard, to submit his own will to the commands\n of his leader, and to sacrifice his life for the safety of\n the emperor and the empire. (33) The attachment of the Roman\n troops to their standards was inspired by the united\n influence of religion and of honour. The golden eagle, which\n glittered in the front of the legion, was the object of\n their fondest devotion; nor was it esteemed less impious\n than it was ignominious, to abandon that sacred ensign in\n the hour of danger. (34) These motives, which derived their\n strength from the imagination, were enforced by fears and\n hopes of a more substantial kind. Regular pay, occasional\n donatives, and a stated recompense, after the appointed time\n of service, alleviated the hardships of the military life,\n (35) whilst, on the other hand, it was impossible for\n cowardice or disobedience to escape the severest punishment.\n The centurions were authorised to chastise with blows, the\n generals had a right to punish with death; and it was an\n inflexible maxim of Roman discipline, that a good soldier\n should dread his officers far more than the enemy. From such\n laudable arts did the valour of the Imperial troops receive\n a degree of firmness and docility, unattainable by the\n impetuous and irregular passions of barbarians.\n \nExercise\n And yet so sensible were the Romans of the imperfection of\n valour without skill and practice, that, in their language,\n the name of an army was borrowed from the word which\n signified exercise. (36) Military exercises were the\n important and unremitted object of their discipline. The\n recruits and young soldiers were constantly trained both in\n the morning and in the evening, nor was age or knowledge\n allowed to excuse the veterans from the daily repetition of\n what they had completely learnt. Large sheds were erected in\n the winter-quarters of the troops, that their useful labours\n might not receive any interruption from the most tempestuous\n weather; and it was carefully observed, that the arms\n destined to this imitation of war, should be of double the\n weight which was required in real action. (37) It is not the\n purpose of this work to enter into any minute description of\n the Roman exercises. We shall only remark, that they\n comprehended whatever could add strength to the body,\n activity to the limbs, or grace to the motions. The soldiers\n were diligently instructed to march, to run, to leap, to\n swim, to carry heavy burdens, to handle every species of\n arms that was used either for offence or for defence, either\n in distant engagement or in a closer onset; to form a\n variety of evolutions; and to move to the sound of flutes,\n in the Pyrrhic or martial dance. (38) In the midst of peace,\n the Roman troops familiarised themselves with the practice\n of war; and it is prettily remarked by an ancient historian\n who had fought against them, that the effusion of blood was\n the only circumstance which distinguished a field of battle\n from a field of exercise. (39) It was the policy of the\n ablest generals, and even of the emperors themselves, to\n encourage these military studies by their presence and\n example; and we are informed that Hadrian, as well as\n Trajan, frequently condescended to instruct the\n unexperienced soldiers, to reward the diligent, and\n sometimes to dispute with them the prize of superior\n strength or dexterity. (40) Under the reigns of those\n princes, the science of tactics was cultivated with success;\n and as long as the empire retained any vigour, their\n military instructions were respected as the most perfect\n model of Roman discipline.\n \nThe legions under the emperors\n Nine centuries of war had gradually introduced into the\n service many alterations and improvements. The legions, as\n they are described by Polybius, (41) in the time of the\n Punic wars, differed very materially from those which\n achieved the victories of Caesar, or defended the monarchy\n of Hadrian and the Antonines. The constitution of the\n Imperial legion may be described in a few words. (42) The\n heavy-armed infantry, which composed its principal strength,\n (43) was divided into ten cohorts, and fifty-five companies,\n under the orders of a correspondent number of tribunes and\n centurions. The first cohort, which always claimed the post\n of honour and the custody of the eagle, was formed of eleven\n hundred and five soldiers, the most approved for valour and\n fidelity. The remaining nine cohorts consisted each of five\n hundred and fifty-five; and the whole body of legionary\n infantry amounted to six thousand one hundred men. Arms Their arms were uniform, and admirably adapted to the nature of their service: an open helmet, with a lofty crest; a\n breast-plate, or coat of mail; greaves on their legs, and an\n ample buckler on their left arm. The buckler was of an\n oblong and concave figure, four feet in length, and two and\n an half in breadth, framed of a light wood, covered with a\n bull's hide, and strongly guarded with plates of brass.\n Besides a lighter spear, the legionary soldier grasped in\n his right hand the formidable pilum, a ponderous javelin,\n whose utmost length was about six feet, and which was\n terminated by a massy triangular point of steel of eighteen\n inches. (44) This instrument was indeed much inferior to our  modern fire-arms; since it was exhausted by a single discharge, at the distance of only ten or twelve paces. Yet when it was launched by a firm and skilful hand, there was not any cavalry that durst venture within its reach, nor any shield or corslet that could sustain the impetuosity of its weight. As soon as the Roman had darted his pilum he drew his sword, and rushed forwards to close with the enemy. His\n sword was a short well-tempered Spanish blade, that carried\n a double edge, and was alike suited to the purpose of\n striking or of pushing; but the soldier was always\n instructed to prefer the latter use of his weapon, as his\n own body remained less exposed, whilst he inflicted a more\n dangerous wound on his adversary. (45) The legion was\n usually drawn up eight deep; and the regular distance of\n three feet was left between the files as well as ranks. (46) \n A body of troops, habituated to preserve this open order, in\n a long front and a rapid charge, found themselves prepared\n to execute every disposition which the circumstances of war,\n or the skill of their leader, might suggest. The soldier\n possessed a free space for his arms and motions, and\n sufficient intervals were allowed, through which seasonable\n reinforcements might be introduced to the relief of the\n exhausted combatants. (47) The tactics of the Greeks and\n Macedonians were formed on very different principles. The\n strength of the phalanx depended on sixteen ranks of long\n pikes, wedged together in the closest array. (48) But it was\n soon discovered by reflection, as well by the event, that\n the strength of the phalanx was unable to contend with the\n activity of the legion. (49) \n \nCavalry\n The cavalry, without which the force of the legion would\n have remained imperfect, was divided into ten troops or\n squadrons; the first, as the companion of the first cohort,\n consisted of an hundred and thirty-two men; whilst each of\n the other nine amounted only to sixty-six. The entire\n establishment formed a regiment, if we may use the modern\n expression, of seven hundred and twenty-six horse, naturally\n connected with its respective legion, but occasionally\n separated to act in the line, and to compose a part of the\n wings of the army. (50) The cavalry of the emperors was no\n longer composed, like that of the ancient republic, of the\n noblest youths of Rome and Italy, who, by performing their\n military service on horseback, prepared themselves for the\n offices of senator and consul; and solicited, by deeds of\n valour, the future suffrages of their countrymen. (51) Since\n the alteration of manners and government, the most wealthy\n of the equestrian order were engaged in the administration\n of justice, and of the revenue; (52) and whenever they\n embraced the profession of arms, they were immediately\n intrusted with a troop of horse, or a cohort of foot. (53) Trajan and Hadrian formed their cavalry from the same provinces, and the same class of their subjects, which\n recruited the ranks of the legion. The horses were bred, for\n the most part, in Spain or Cappadocia. The Roman troopers\n despised the complete armour with which the cavalry of the\n East was encumbered. Their more useful arms consisted in a\n helmet, an oblong shield, light boots, and a coat of mail. A\n javelin, and a long broad-sword, were their principal\n weapons of offence. The use of lances and of iron maces they\n seem to have borrowed from the barbarians. (54) \n \n Auxiliaries\n The safety and honour of the empire were principally\n intrusted to the legions, but the policy of Rome\n condescended to adopt every useful instrument of war.\n Considerable levies were regularly made among the\n provincials, who had not yet deserved the honourable\n distinction of Romans. Many dependent princes and\n communities, dispersed round the frontiers, were permitted\n for a while, to hold their freedom and security by the\n tenure of military service. (55) Even select troops of\n hostile barbarians were frequently compelled or persuaded to\n consume their dangerous valour in remote climates, and for\n the benefit of the state. (56) All these were included under\n the general name of auxiliaries; and howsoever they might\n vary according to the difference of times and circumstances,\n their numbers were seldom much inferior to those of the\n legions themselves. (57) Among the auxiliaries, the bravest\n and most faithful bands were placed under the command of\n praefects and centurions, and severely trained in the arts\n of Roman discipline; but the far greater part retained those\n arms, to which the nature of their country, or their early\n habits of life, more peculiarly adapted them. By this\n institution each legion, to whom a certain proportion of\n auxiliaries was allotted, contained within itself every\n species of lighter troops, and of missile weapons, and was\n capable of encountering every nation, with the advantages of\n its respective arms and discipline. (58) Nor was the legion\n destitute of what, in modern language, would be styled a\nArtillery train of artillery. It consisted in ten military engines of the largest, and fifty-five of a smaller size; but all of which, either in an oblique or horizontal manner, discharged stones and darts with irresistible violence. (59) \n \nEncampment\n The camp of a Roman legion presented the appearance of a\n fortified city. (60) As soon as the space was marked out,\n the pioneers carefully levelled the ground, and removed\n every impediment that might interrupt its perfect\n regularity. Its form was an exact quadrangle; and we may calculate that\n a square of about seven hundred yards was sufficient for the\n encampment of twenty thousand Romans; though a similar\n number of our own troops would expose to the enemy a front\n of more than treble that extent. In the midst of the camp,\n the praetorium, or general's quarters, rose above the\n others; the cavalry, the infantry, and the auxiliaries\n occupied their respective stations; the streets were broad\n and perfectly straight, and a vacant space of two hundred\n feet was left on all sides, between the tents and the\n rampart. The rampart itself was usually twelve feet high,\n armed with a line of strong and intricate palisades, and\n defended by a ditch of twelve feet in depth as well as in\n breadth. This important labour was performed by the hands of\n the legionaries themselves, to whom the use of the spade and\n the pick-axe was no less familiar than that of the sword or\n pilum. Active valour may often be the present of nature; but\n such patient diligence can be the fruit only of habit and\n discipline. (61) \n \nMarch\n Whenever the trumpet gave the signal of departure, the camp\n was almost instantly broke up, and the troops fell into\n their ranks without delay or confusion. Besides their arms,\n which the legionaries scarcely considered as an encumbrance,\n they were laden with their kitchen furniture, the\n instruments of fortification, and the provision of many\n days. (62) Under this weight, which would oppress the\n delicacy of a modern soldier, they were trained by a regular\n step to advance, in about six hours, near twenty miles. (63) \n On the appearance of an enemy, they threw aside their\n baggage, and by easy and rapid evolutions converted the\n column of march into an order of battle. (64) The slingers\n and archers skirmished in the front; the auxiliaries formed\n the first line, and were seconded or sustained by the\n strength of the legions: the cavalry covered the flanks, and\n the military engines were placed in the rear.\n \nNumber and disposition of the legions\n Such were the arts of war by which the Roman emperors\n defended their extensive conquests, and preserved a military\n spirit, at a time when every other virtue was oppressed by\n luxury and despotism. If, in the consideration of their\n armies, we pass from their discipline to their numbers, we\n shall not find it easy to define them with any tolerable\n accuracy. We may computes however, that the legion, which\n was itself a body of six thousand eight hundred and thirty\n one Romans, might, with its attendant auxiliaries amount to\n about twelve thousand five hundred men. The peace\n establishment of Hadrian and his successors was composed of\n no less than thirty of these formidable brigades; and most\n probably formed a standing force of three hundred and\n seventy-five thousand men. Instead of being confined within\n the walls of fortified cities, which the Romans considered\n as the refuge of weakness or pusillanimity, the legions were\n encamped on the banks of the great rivers, and along the\n frontiers of the barbarians. As their stations, for the most\n part, remained fixed and permanent, we may venture to\n describe the distribution of the troops. Three legions were\n sufficient for Britain. The principal strength lay upon the\n Rhine and Danube, and consisted of sixteen legions, in the\n following proportions: two in the Lower and three in the\n Upper Germany; one in Rhaetia, one in Noricum, four in\n Pannonia, three in Maesia, and two in Dacia. The defence of\n the Euphrates was entrusted to eight legions, six of whom\n were planted in Syria, and the other two in Cappadocia. With\n regard to Egypt, Africa, and Spain, as they were far removed\n from any important scene of war, a single legion maintained\n the domestic tranquillity of each of those great provinces.\n Even Italy was not left destitute of a military force. Above\n twenty thousand chosen soldiers, distinguished by the titles\n of City Cohorts and Praetorian Guards, watched over the\n safety of the monarch and the capital. As the authors of\n almost every revolution that distracted the empire, the\n Praetorians will, very soon, and very loudly, demand our\n attention; but in their arms and institution, we cannot find\n any circumstance which discriminated them from the legions,\n unless it were a more splendid appearance, and a less rigid\n discipline. (65) \n \nNavy\n The navy maintained by the emperors might seem inadequate to\n their greatness; but it was fully sufficient for every\n useful purpose of government. The ambition of the Romans was\n confined to the land; nor was that warlike people ever\n actuated by the enterprising spirit which had prompted the\n navigators of Tyre, of Carthage, and even of Marseilles, to\n enlarge the bounds of the world, and to explore the most\n remote coasts of the ocean. To the Romans the ocean remained\n an object of terror rather than of curiosity; (66) the whole  extent of the Mediterranean, after the destruction of Carthage, and the extirpation of the pirates, was included within their provinces. The policy of the emperors was directed only to preserve the peaceful dominion of that sea, and to protect the commerce of their subjects. With these moderate views, Augustus stationed two permanent fleets in the most convenient ports of Italy, the one at Ravenna, on the Adriatic, the other at Misenum, in the bay of Naples. Experience seems at length to have convinced the ancients, that as soon as their galleys exceeded two, or at the most three ranks of oars, they were suited rather for vain pomp than for real service. Augustus himself, in the victory of Actium, had seen the superiority of his own light frigates (they were called Liburnians) over the lofty but unwieldy castles of his rivals. (67) Of these Liburnians he composed the two fleets of Ravenna and Misenum, destined to command, the one the eastern, the other the western division of the  Mediterranean; and to each of the squadrons he attached a  body of several thousand marines. Besides these two ports,  which may be considered as the principal seats of the Roman\n navy, a very considerable force was stationed at Frejus, on\n the coast of Provence, and the Euxine was guarded by forty\n ships, and three thousand soldiers. To all these we add the\n fleet which preserved the communication between Gaul and\n Britain, and a great number of vessels constantly maintained\n on the Rhine and Danube, to harass the country, or to\n intercept the passage of the barbarians. (68) If we review\n Amount of the whole establishment\n this general state of the Imperial forces; of the cavalry as\n well as infantry; of the legions, the auxiliaries, the  guards, and the navy; the most liberal computation will not  allow us to fix the entire establishment by sea and by land  at more than four hundred and fifty thousand men- a military power, which, however, formidable it may seem, was equalled by a monarch of the last century, whose kingdom was confined\n within a single province of the Roman empire. (69)View of the provinces of the Roman empire\n We have attempted to explain the spirit which moderated, and\n the strength which supported, the power of Hadrian and the\n Antonines. We shall now endeavour, with clearness and\n precision, to describe the provinces once united under their\n sway, but, at present, divided into so many independent and\n hostile estates.\n \nSpain\n Spain, the western extremity of the empire of Europe, and of\n the ancient world, has, in every age, invariably preserved\n the same natural limits; the Pyrenaean mountains, the\n Mediterranean, and the Atlantic Ocean. That great peninsula,\n at present so unequally divided between two sovereigns, was\n distributed by Augustus into three provinces, Lusitania,\n Baetica, and Tarraconensis. The kingdom of Portugal now\n fills the place of the warlike country of the Lusitanians;\n and the loss sustained by the former, on the side of the\n East is compensated by an accession of territory towards the\n North. The confines of Grenada and Andalusia correspond with\n those of ancient Baetica. The remainder of Spain, Gallicia\n and the Asturias, Biscay and Navarre, Leon and the two\n Castilles, Murcia, Valencia, Catalonia, and Arragon, all\n contributed to form the third and most considerable of the\n Roman governments, which, from the name of its capital, was\n styled the province of Tarragona. (70) Of the native\n barbarians, the Celtiberians were the most powerful, as the\n Cantabrians and Asturians proved the most obstinate.\n Confident in the strength of their mountains, they were the\n last who submitted to the arms of Rome, and the first who\n threw off the yoke of the Arabs.\n \nGaul\n Ancient Gaul, as it contained the whole country between the\n Pyrenees, the Alps, the Rhine, and the Ocean, was of greater\n extent than modern France. To the dominions of that powerful\n monarchy, with its recent acquisitions of Alsace and\n Lorraine, we must add the duchy of Savoy, the cantons of\n Switzerland, the four electorates of the Rhine, and the\n territories of Liege, Luxemburg, Hainault, Flanders, and\n Brabant. When Augustus gave laws to the conquests of his\n father, he introduced a division of Gaul equally adapted to\n the progress of the legions, to the course of the rivers,\n and to the principal national distinctions, which had\n comprehended above an hundred independent states. (71) The\n seacoast of the Mediterranean, Languedoc, Provence, and\n Dauphine, received their provincial appellation from the\n colony of Narbonne. The government of Aquitaine was extended\n from the Pyrenees to the Loire. The country between the\n Loire and the Seine was styled the Celtic Gaul, and soon\n borrowed a new denomination from the celebrated colony of\n Lugdunum, or Lyons. The Belgic lay beyond the Seine, and in\n more ancient times had been bounded only by the Rhine; but a\n little before the age of Caesar the Germans, abusing their\n superiority of valour, had occupied a considerable portion\n of the Belgic territory. The Roman conquerors very eagerly\n embraced so flattering a circumstance, and the Gallic\n frontier of the Rhine, from Basil to Leyden, received the\n pompous names of the Upper and the Lower Germany. (72) Such,\n under the reign of the Antonines, were the six provinces of\n Gaul - the Narbonnese, Aquitaine, the Celtic, or Lyonnese,\n the Belgic, and the two Germanies.\n \nBritain\n We have already had occasion to mention the conquest of\n Britain, and to fix the boundary of the Roman province in\n this island. It comprehended all England, Wales, and the\n Lowlands of Scotland, as far as Dumbarton and Edinburgh.\n Before Britain lost her freedom, the country was irregularly\n divided between thirty tribes of barbarians, of whom the\n most considerable were the Belgae in the West, the Brigantes\n in the North, the Silures in South Wales, and the Iceni in\n Norfolk and Suffolk. (73) As far as we can either trace or\n credit the resemblance of manners and language, Spain, Gaul,\n and Britain were peopled by the same hardy race of savages.\n Before they yielded to the Roman arms, they often disputed\n the field, and often renewed the contest. After their\n submission they constituted the western division of the\n European provinces, which extended from the columns of\n Hercules to the wall of Antoninus and from the mouth of the\n Tagus to the sources of the Rhine and Danube.\n \nItaly\n Before the Roman conquest, the country which is now called\n Lombardy was not considered as a part of Italy. It had been\n occupied by a powerful colony of Gauls, who settling\n themselves along the banks of the Po, from Piedmont to\n Romagna, carried their arms and diffused their names from\n the Alps to the Apennine. The Ligurians dwelt on the rocky\n coast, which now forms the republic of Genoa. Venice was yet\n unborn; but the territories of that state, which lie to the\n east of the Adige, were inhabited by the Venetians. (74) The\n middle part of the peninsula that now composes the duchy of\n Tuscany and the ecclesiastical state, was the ancient seat\n of the Estruscans and Umbrians to the former of whom Italy\n was indebted for the first rudiments of civilised life. (75) The Tiber rolled at the foot of the seven hills of Rome, and\n the country of the Sabines, the Latins, and the Volsci, from\n that river to the frontiers of Naples, was the theatre of\n her infant victories. On that celebrated ground the first\n consuls deserved triumphs; their successors adorned villas,\n and their posterity have erected convents. (76) Capua and\n Campania possessed the immediate territory of Naples; the\n rest of the kingdom was inhabited by many warlike nations,\n the Marsi, the Samnites, the Apulians, and the Lucanians;\n and the sea coasts had been covered by the flourishing\n colonies of the Greeks. We may remark, that when Augustus\n divided Italy into eleven regions, the little province of\n Istria was annexed to that seat of Roman sovereignty. (77) \n \nThe Danube and Illyrian frontier\n The European provinces of Rome were protected by the course\n of the Rhine and the Danube. The latter of those mighty\n streams, which rises at the distance of only thirty miles\n from the former, flows above thirteen hundred miles, for the\n most part, to the south-east, collects the tribute of sixty\n navigable rivers, and is, at length, through six mouths,\n received into the Euxine, which appears scarcely equal to\n such an accession of waters. (78) The provinces of the\n Danube soon acquired the general appellation of lllyricum,\n or the Illyrian frontier, (79) and were esteemed the most\n warlike of the empire; but they deserve to be more\n particularly considered under the names of Rhaetia, Noricum,\n Pannonia, Dalmatia, Dacia, Maesia, Thrace, Macedonia, and\n Greece.\n \nRhaetia\n The province of Rhaetia, which soon extinguished the name of\n the Vindelicians, extended from the summit of the Alps to\n the banks of the Danube; from its source, as far as its\n conflux with the Inn. The greatest part of the flat country\n is subject to the elector of Bavaria; the city of Augsburg\n is protected by the constitution of the German empire; the\n Grisons are safe in their mountains, and the country of\n Tyrol is ranked among the numerous provinces of the house of\n Austria.\n \nNoricum and Pannonia\n The wide extent of territory, which is included between the\n Inn, the Danube, and the Save; Austria, Styria, Carinthia,\n Carniola, the Lower Hungary, and Sclavonia, was known to the\n ancients under the names of Noricum and Pannonia. In their\n original state of independence, their fierce inhabitants\n were intimately connected. Under the Roman government they\n were frequently united, and they still remain the patrimony\n of a single family. They now contain the residence of a\n German prince, who styles himself Emperor of the Romans, and\n form the centre, as well as strength, of the Austrian power.\n It may not be improper to observe, that if we except\n Bohemia, Moravia, the northern skirts of Austria, and a part\n of Hungary, between the Theiss and the Danube, all the other\n dominions of the House of Austria were comprised within the\n limits of the Roman empire.\n \nDalmatia\n Dalmatia, to which the name of Illyricum more properly\n belonged, was a long but narrow tract between the Save and\n the Adriatic. The best part of the sea-coast, which still\n retains its ancient appellation, is a province of the\n Venetian state, and the seat of the little republic of\n Ragusa. The inland parts have assumed the Sclavonian names\n of Croatia and Bosnia; the former obeys an Austrian\n governor, the latter a Turkish pasha; but the whole country\n is still infested by tribes of barbarians, whose savage\n independence irregularly marks the doubtful limit of the\n Christian and Mahometan power. (80) \n \nMoesia and Dacia\n After the Danube had received the waters of the Theiss and\n the Save, it acquired, at least among the Greeks, the name\n of Ister. (81) It formerly divided Maesia and Dacia, the\n latter of which, as we have already seen, was a conquest of\n Trajan, and the only province beyond the river. If we\n inquire into the present state of those countries, we shall\n find that, on the left hand of the Danube, Temeswar and\n Transylvania have been annexed, after many revolutions, to\n the crown of Hungary; whilst the principalities of Moldavia\n and Wallachia acknowledge the supremacy of the Ottoman\n Porte. On the right hand of the Danube, Maesia, which,\n during the middle ages, was broken into the barbarian\n kingdoms of Servia and Bulgaria, is again united in Turkish\n slavery.\n \nThrace, Macedonia, and Greece\n The appellation of Roumelia, which is still bestowed by the\n Turks on the extensive countries of Thrace, Macedonia, and\n Greece, preserves the memory of their ancient state under\n the Roman empire. In the time of the Antonines, the martial\n regions of Thrace, from the mountains of Haemus and Rhodope,\n to the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, had assumed the form of\n a province. Notwithstanding the change of masters and of\n religion, the new city of Rome, founded by Constantine on\n the banks of the Bosphorus, has ever since remained the\n capital of a great monarchy. The kingdom of Macedonia,\n which, under the reign of Alexander, gave laws to Asia,\n derived more solid advantages from the policy of the two\n Philips; and with its dependencies of Epirus and Thessaly,\n extended from the Aegean to the Ionian Sea. When we reflect\n on the fame of Thebes and Argos, of Sparta and Athens, we\n can scarcely persuade ourselves that so many immortal\n republics of ancient Greece were lost in a single province\n of the Roman empire, which, from the superior influence of\n the Achaean league, was usually denominated the province of\n Achaia.\n \nAsia Minor\n Such was the state of Europe under the Roman emperors. The\n provinces of Asia, without excepting the transient conquests\n of Trajan, are all comprehended within the limits of the\n Turkish power. But, instead of following the arbitrary\n divisions of despotism and ignorance, it will be safer for\n us, as well as more agreeable, to observe the indelible\n characters of nature. The name of Asia Minor is attributed\n with some propriety to the peninsula, which, confined\n betwixt the Euxine and the Mediterranean, advances from the\n Euphrates towards Europe. The most extensive and flourishing\n district, westward of Mount Taurus and the river Halys, was\n dignified by the Romans with the exclusive title of Asia.\n The jurisdiction of that province extended over the ancient\n monarchies of Troy, Lydia, and Phrygia, the maritime\n countries of the Pamphylians, Lycians, and Carians, and the\n Grecian colonies of Ionia, which equalled in arts, though\n not in arms, the glory of their parent. The kingdoms of\n Bithynia and Pontus possessed the northern side of the\n peninsula from Constantinople to Trebizond. On the opposite\n side, the province of Cilicia was terminated by the\n mountains of Syria: the inland country, separated from the\n Roman Asia by the river Halys, and from Armenia by the\n Euphrates, had once formed the independent kingdom of\n Cappadocia. In this place we may observe that the northern\n shores of the Euxine, beyond Trebizond in Asia, and beyond\n the Danube in Europe, acknowledged the sovereignty of the\n emperors, and received at their hands either tributary\n princes or Roman garrisons. Budzak, Crim Tartary, Circassia,\n and Mingrelia, are the modern appellations of those savage\n countries. (82) \n \nSyria, Phoenicia, and Palestine\n Under the successors of Alexander, Syria was the seat of the\n Seleucidae, who reigned over Upper Asia, till the successful\n revolt of the Parthians confined their dominions between the\n Euphrates and the Mediterranean. When Syria became subject\n to the Romans, it formed the eastern frontier of their\n empire; nor did that province, in its utmost latitude, know\n any other bounds than the mountains of Cappadocia to the\n north, and towards the south the confines of Egypt, and the\n Red Sea. Phoenicia and Palestine were sometimes annexed to,\n and sometimes separated from, the jurisdiction of Syria. The\n former of these was a narrow and rocky coast; the latter was\n a territory scarcely superior to Wales, either in fertility\n or extent. Yet Phoenicia and Palestine will for ever live in\n the memory of mankind; since America, as well as Europe, has\n received letters from the one, and religion from the other.\n (83) A sandy desert alike destitute of wood and water skirts  along the doubtful confine of Syria, from the Euphrates to the Red Sea. The wandering life of the Arabs was inseparably\n connected with their independence; and wherever, on some\n spots less barren than the rest, they ventured to form any\n settled habitation, they soon became subjects to the Roman\n empire. (84) \n \nEgypt\n The geographers of antiquity have frequently hesitated to\n what portion of the globe they should ascribe Egypt. (85) By\n its situation that celebrated kingdom is included within the\n immense peninsula of Africa; but it is accessible only on\n the side of Asia, whose revolutions, in almost every period\n of history, Egypt has humbly obeyed. A Roman praefect was\n seated on the splendid throne of the Ptolemies; and the iron\n sceptre of the Mamalukes is now in the hands of a Turkish\n pasha. The Nile flows down the country, above five hundred\n miles from the tropic of Cancer to the Mediterranean, and\n marks, on either side, the extent of fertility by the\n measure of its inundations. Cyrene, situate towards the\n west, and along the sea-coast, was first a Greek colony,\n afterwards a province of Egypt, and is now lost in the\n desert of Barca.\n \nAfrica\n From Cyrene to the ocean, the coast of Africa extends above\n fifteen hundred miles; yet so closely is it pressed between\n the Mediterranean and the Sahara, or sandy desert, that its\n breadth seldom exceeds fourscore or an hundred miles. The\n eastern division was considered by the Romans as the more\n peculiar and proper province of Africa. Till the arrival of\n the Phoenician colonies, that fertile country was inhabited\n by the Libyans, the most savage of mankind. Under the\n immediate jurisdiction of Carthage, it became the centre of\n commerce and empire; but the republic of Carthage is now\n degenerated into the feeble and disorderly states of Tripoli\n and Tunis. The military government of Algiers oppresses the\n wide extent of Numidia, as it was once united under\n Massinissa and Jugurtha: but in the time of Augustus, the\n limits of Numidia were contracted; and, at least, two-thirds\n of the country acquiesced in the name of Mauritania, with\n the epithet of Caesariensis. The genuine Mauritania, or\n country of the Moors, which, from the ancient city of Tingi,\n or Tangier, was distinguished by the appellation of\n Tingitana, is represented by the modern kingdom of Fez.\n Salle, on the Ocean, long infamous for its piratical\n depredations, was noticed by the Romans, as the extreme\n object of their power, and almost of their geography. A city\n of their foundation may still be discovered near Mequinez,\n the residence of the barbarian whom we condescend to style\n the Emperor of Morocco; but it does not appear that his more\n southern dominions, Morocco itself, and Segelmessa, were\n ever comprehended within the Roman province. The western\n parts of Africa are intersected by the branches of Mount\n Atlas, a name so idly celebrated by the fancy of poets;(86) \n but which is now diffused over the immense ocean that rolls\n between the ancient and the new continent. (87) \n \nThe Mediterranean with its islands\n Having now finished the circuit of the Roman empire, we may\n observe, that Africa is divided from Spain by a narrow\n strait of about twelve miles, through which the Atlantic\n flows into the Mediterranean. The columns of Hercules, so\n famous among the ancients, were two mountains which seemed\n to have been torn asunder by some convulsion of the\n elements; and at the foot of the European mountain the\n fortress of Gibraltar is now seated. The whole extent of the\n Mediterranean Sea, its coasts, and its islands, were\n comprised within the Roman dominion. Of the larger islands,\n the two Baleares, which derive their name of Majorca and\n Minorca from their respective size, are subject at present,\n the former to Spain, the latter to Great Britain. It is\n easier to deplore the fate, than to describe the actual\n condition, of Corsica. Two Italian sovereigns assume a regal\n title from Sardinia and Sicily. Crete, or Candia, with\n Cyprus, and most of the smaller islands of Greece and Asia,\n have been subdued by the Turkish arms; whilst the little\n rock of Malta defies their power, and has emerged, under the\n government of its military Order, into fame and opulence.\n \nGeneral idea of the Roman empire\n This long enumeration of provinces, whose broken fragments\n have formed so many powerful kingdoms, might almost induce\n us to forgive the vanity or ignorance of the ancients.\n Dazzled with the extensive sway, the irresistible strength,\n and the real or affected moderation of the emperors, they\n permitted themselves to despise, and sometimes to forget,\n the outlying countries which had been left in the enjoyment\n of a barbarous independence; and they gradually usurped the\n licence of confounding the Roman monarchy with the globe of\n the earth. (88) But the temper, as well as knowledge, of a\n modern historian requires a more sober and accurate\n language. He may impress a juster image of the greatness of\n Rome, by observing that the empire was above two thousand\n miles in breadth, from the wall of Antoninus and the\n northern limits of Dacia, to mount Atlas and the tropic of\n Cancer; that it extended, in length, more than three\n thousand miles from the Western Ocean to the Euphrates; that\n it was situated in the finest part of the Temperate Zone,\n between the twenty-fourth and fifty-sixth degrees of\n northern latitude; and that it was supposed to contain above\n sixteen hundred thousand square miles, for the most part of\n fertile and well-cultivated land.
