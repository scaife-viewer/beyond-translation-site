`wegner-corrected-finalized-versions.csv` was extracted from the "Finalized Versions" worksheet and had a small correction made.

`wegner-corrected-treebank.csv` was extracted from the "UD Treebank" worksheet.

`crit.xml` was copied from https://github.com/perseids-publications/pedalion-trees/blob/master/public/xml/crit.xml

`0059-003.xml` was copied from https://github.com/gregorycrane/glaux-trees/blob/master/public/xml/0059-003.xml

`word_alignment.py` is a script I started to try and map values from `wegner-corrected-treebank.csv` to `ve_ref` identifiers; this would be required to model a "word-level" alignment.
